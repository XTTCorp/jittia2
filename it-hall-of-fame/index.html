                    <p>The first great calculating machines spent the 1940s helping the Allied powers win World War II. Just before 1950, many machines whose existence had been classified were unveiled to the public virtually all at once, battle-tested and ready to rescue a 20th century that, to anyone who survived up to that point, seemed overrated. The world needed to get to work, and the first business computers pointed the way forward.</p>
                    <p>By 1949, Cambridge University had successfully engineered a way for EDSAC’s memory tubes to retain binary digits, earning it the moniker “electronic brain.” England, America, and a re-emergent Germany raced to develop commercial models that could fund their own research. UNIVAC, first purchased by the US Census Bureau, made evident the need to make workloads easily portable. Magnetic tape provided input and output for the first time, and in so doing, divided program instructions from numeric values. In describing how this system worked, UNIVAC’s engineers re-injected an old Latin word into the world’s vocabulary: data.</p>

For computers to be accepted in the everyday workplace, they needed a working demo.</p>
                    <p>Nothing brings a concept down to earth like a good space program. America’s mission to the moon re-invented the computer. No longer was it a gargantuan box that digested data from tapes and punch cards. NASA redesigned it as a networked communications complex, with operations centers stationed across the planet. At its heart was a data center, which maintained the central repository for its network. Remote terminals, grouped together in command centers, became workstations. The connections between these components were interfaces. The Apollo mission became the staging ground for how interoperable organizations would function throughout the next half-century.</p>

                    <p>The space program proved that miniaturization not only made for less expensive computers but for better built ones.  But none of the major manufacturers in 1970 — Honeywell, Sperry Univac, Burroughs, DEC, and maybe least of all, IBM — directly foresaw the evolutionary path from microchips to miniaturization to mass production to democratization of computing technology.</p>
                    <p>When Intel produced its 4004 microprocessor in 1971, its intended use was in everyday devices like fire alarm systems and traffic lights.  Three years later, when Intel’s 8080 became available on the open market, garage hobbyists were the first to devise 8-bit programming language interpreters and rudimentary operating systems.  And when this new “software” was offered to Intel, IBM, and others, they rejected it as having no useful value.</p>
                    <p>So the hobbyists created an industry unto themselves.  By 1977, its leaders were already firmly established: the hobbyist electronics retailer Radio Shack; the former calculator manufacturer Commodore; and a quirky new brand led by a couple of renegades from an oscilloscope maker and a video game company that, in honor of the Beatles, adopted the name Apple Computer.  Together, these consumer brands precipitated the decline of the mainframe as the principal facilitator of computing power.</p>

                    <p>As the first great era of ubiquitous computing came to an end, the question of how the world would compute was being addressed by hardware: the design of the processor, the memory map of the internal ROM, the speed of storage and retrieval.</p>
                    <p>As the first great era of ubiquitous computing came to an end, the question of how the world would compute was being addressed by hardware: the design of the processor, the memory map of the internal ROM, the speed of storage and retrieval.</p>
                    <p>The world of computing as we know it today was largely shaped by the decision made by IBM to let a small company, Microsoft, design and implement the operating system for the IBM PC, called PC DOS, which enabled the small software maker license the same operating system, now called MS-DOS, to others.</p>
                    <p>IBM may have assumed there would be no “others” that could produce a personal computer that had the scale and interoperability of an IBM machine. The reverse-engineering of IBM’s BIOS, coupled with Microsoft’s ability to license MS-DOS, led to the era of “IBM compatibility.” The rise of “clone” computers led to a computing platform with unprecedented scale and reach into businesses.</p>
                    <p>Businesses began to see the need to coordinate and synchronize their computing operations. Local-area networking refocused the computing industry away from CPUs, floppy diskettes, and the first hard drives, and toward sharing, interoperability, and bandwidth. Novell, 3Com, and the first microcomputer network engineers hammered out the first communications principles for the new medium.</p>
                    <p>It was the software industry that drove the course of computing for the first time – and from that time forward. The first file-sharing operating systems and the arrival of Ethernet hardware addressed the task of reconciling transactions from multiple users in the same office.</p>

                    <p>The Internet was a reality as early as the late 1970s, but back then it was seen as little more than an academic experiment. By the dawn of the 1980s, a few thousand people began using it as an exchange mechanism for electronic mail. What would set off a global economic revolution was, ironically, another academic experiment: a curiosity, being investigated by a CERN particle physicist in his spare time, about making a HyperCard-like document stack supported by a networked database rather than a localized one.</p>
                    <p>Tim Berners-Lee’s little experiment first tripped off an electronic publishing revolution. But it was dwarfed by an even greater one: the discovery that programs could be carried out by networks rather than just the computers connected by networks. The World-Wide Web completed the computer’s transformation from a calculating machine, to a communications device, to a social tool. It became the fuel for developing nations, educating and empowering people hundreds of miles distant from anything resembling a school, making millions of people into full participants in the world.</p>

                    <p>The “dot-com bubble” was the biggest and hardest lesson ever learned by the computing industry. Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the fact that so many millions of consumers were interested in modem communications and the early Web, was no longer enough for investors to place big bets on startups without business models.</p>
                    <p>It no longer made sense for anyone to build a new computing technology without a very compelling reason. Cost reduction became the foundation for essentially every attempt at building new computing platforms, and was the inspiration for a new effort at driving up the efficiency of processors running portable workloads. Virtualization was born from the need for servers – which would soon become the heart of data centers – to maximize the efficiency of their processors while driving the performance of their workloads.</p>
                    <p>In the early 2000s, engineers experimenting with the potential benefits of workload sharing among server processors came upon the realization that there may be a way to move active workloads between encapsulated virtual machines, from processor to processor – first along the same network fabric, and later across a much wider Internet pipeline than had ever been used before.</p>
                    <p>The major networking and virtualization products makers at the time were slow to embrace the concept. Live migration, some said, would be a passing fad. They believed as processors continued to gain performance advantages, workloads would become centralized, not distributed. But engineers at NASA proved them wrong, creating the first real-world use case for distributed processing across servers contained in shipping crates. They created the prototype for what we now call the cloud.</p>

                    <p>The cloud can serve any class of device wherever it may reside, and however it may be connected. As a result, the old and oft-repeated promise of workplace mobility has finally become a reality. But it’s not the devices themselves that are responsible for mobility, but the servers and networks that support them.</p>
                    <p>Connectivity has become a commodity, as constant as electricity and running water, yet it follows you wherever you go. Compute power has become centralized once again, and the data center — once again designed by NASA — has regained its place at the heart of computing. These data centers, thanks to the hybrid cloud and the precedent set by Amazon, have evolved to become service providers. Virtualization now enables workloads to be staged in one data center, scaled up and down, and moved to other data centers across the globe, all without customers noticing a service disruption.</p>
                    <p>Users are no longer tied down to single computers, and their data is no longer bound to hard drives. And thus, the nature of software is transforming all over again.</p>

                    <p>It was the holiday season of 1974. Two former classmates of Lakeside Elementary School were walking through a Seattle mall, probably looking for something other than literature. Paul, older by two years, happened across the January 1975 issue of <em>Popular Electronics</em>, whose kit of the month was a real computer with a microprocessor that readers could build and program at home.</p>
                    <p>Bill, the youngest, had always been goading Paul to form a company with him. They had tried a traffic data pattern analysis company together, but it failed. Paul considered a company that could build programs that people could run on this Altair kit computer. Rather than build one himself, he devised an Altair simulator on a DEC PDP-10, which Bill would use to make a BASIC interpreter. Later, Paul realized that with simulators, they could devise programs for more than one type of computer. Thus Paul Allen conceived the first genuine software firm independent from hardware manufacturers. Juxtaposing some words he gleaned from magazine articles, in <strong>1975</strong>, he dubbed his firm “Micro-Soft.”</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 1980, IBM was preparing to produce a personal computer, and it was doing a poor job of keeping it a secret. Most of the people who built operating systems knew and even liked one another. So when IBM first approached Microsoft about producing an OS for a PC, Bill Gates referred IBM to another company: DRI, whose chief, Gary Kildall, was producing CP/M.</p>
                    <p>IBM took Gates’ advice. But during an initial <strong>1981</strong> meeting with IBM for which Kildall failed to show up, his wife refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement for a PC whose existence most of the world actually knew. So the IBM negotiators returned to Microsoft, where newly hired business manager Steve Ballmer took the lead before Gates could send them elsewhere. With IBM looking to minimize costs, Ballmer negotiated a deal where Microsoft produced PC-DOS in exchange for royalties, and the right to license DOS to others. Microsoft had not yet even contributed code to PC-DOS; it had purchased QDOS outright from a former employee.</p>
                    <p>It was the first operating system platform, running software made for the IBM PC on other computers — something CP/M could not do. Ballmer’s deal gave rise to the modern software industry.</p>

                    <p>By March of 2000, the past several years of collective speculation over the perpetually rising value of the technology market, came to an abrupt halt. Intel had just made a massive investment in licensing rights to a high-speed memory technology from Rambus. This led to a price premium for PCs that competitor AMD exploited to its advantage, building chipsets for motherboards that allowed for less expensive DRAM chips.</p>
                    <p>After the “dot-com bubble” burst, and the terrorist strikes on New York and Washington, sales of PCs with Intel chips fell, and Intel stock plummeted. The company’s veteran COO Craig Barrett had been CEO for only two years, and was starting to be blamed for the downturn. Barrett’s bold response in <strong>2001</strong> began with a re-assessment of the strategies that led to the decision to partner with Rambus. That study found that too many architectural decisions had been made for separate components, without regard to how they affected the platform as a whole. Then, during the depths of the recession, Barrett ordered an $8 billion re-investment in a single, synchronized R&amp;D track. It came to be known as the “tick-tock” strategy, and it powered Intel back into a position of market dominance.</p>

His beginnings in the industry were humble – starting in the mail room at IBM in 1977. Nevertheless, he applied himself to the role, vowing to, in his words, "show up and get things done."</p>
                    <p>This credo served him well, and over the next three decades he climbed upward through the ranks to end his tenure at Big Blue as its top channel executive – a long way from stuffing envelopes in mailboxes. The accolades came – in 2003, his work at IBM earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award from VARBusiness Magazine. In 2008, Vitagliano was inducted into the Ingram Micro VentureTech Network (VTN) Hall of Fame. </p>
                    <p>Upon retirement from IBM in 2005, Vitagliano moved to Juniper Networks as senior vice president and global channel chief, solidifying the vendor’s position as a channel-friendly networking and security leader.

                    <p>As late the early 1990s, not all software companies believed they had a mandate to be structured like corporations. In 1991, Alvar Green had found himself in a precarious position. He had been the executive vice president of finance for Autodesk for a very long time, and for emphasizing the bottom line, he had been relegated to the CEO’s post. Fed up with calling meetings that no one — even the chairman — would bother to attend, Green tendered his resignation. But before he did, he found perhaps the least likely possible successor: Carol Bartz, a respected vice president at Sun Microsystems, and a hard-liner businesswoman to the core.</p>
                    <p>One of Bartz’ first moves in <strong>1992</strong> was to cancel the weekly company drinking parties, called “beer busts.” That made her, for a time, less respected than her predecessor, until her subordinates watched her deal, day by day, with the process of shaping up her company to perform like a publicly traded corporation, all while battling breast cancer — and winning. She trimmed development projects, focusing less on the experimental and more on the commercially viable. Soon, Bartz was the unchallenged leader of the organization, holding the CEO post for 14 years.</p>

                    <p>The programs that gave purpose to the first business computers were not very portable. When universities wanted to lease time on their computers to other institutions, the cost of clearing out one tenant’s programs and punching in the next one’s, actually made the timesharing concept unaffordable.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by a 1964 <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> article entitled, “The Computers of Tomorrow,” a consortium of the world’s computer laboratories investigated the feasibility of an “information utility,” similar to an electric or communications utility. The group needed automation to change out the programs, so together they developed a “control program” for the GE-645, called MULTICS. But consortium member Bell Labs concluded it was too unwieldy. In April <strong>1969</strong>, Bell pulled out of the project to pursue its own alternative.</p>
                    <p>Priority #1 for Bell was to ensure the new system could run engineer Ken Thompson’s cool game, <em>Space Travel</em>. With that in mind, Thompson and partner Dennis Ritchie re-created the functionality of the GE-645 unit for a DEC PDP-7. By October, the new “operating system” was functional. Another year passed before they settled upon a good name for it: UNIX.</p>

                    <p>Through the 1960s, Digital Equipment Corporation did more than any other manufacturer to make computers smaller and less expensive. But it also sparked the transition of the computing device from a mere calculation engine into a data communications device.</p>
                    <p>This realization came about as a result of an architectural strategy of componentization — making smaller, interchangeable parts that fit together. DEC’s principal engineer, and the designer of its more successful Programmable Data Processor (PDP) series, was Gordon Bell. He accomplished componentization through the creation of the data bus, enabling integrated circuits to plug into a system and expand it. But communicating with the bus required synchronization with the clock of the machine running the bus. This made it hard to envision connecting any device with an independent processor.</p>
                    <p>So as essentially a means to an end, for the PDP-1 in <strong>1960</strong>, Bell invented a component called a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART). Chips that receive data from asynchronous sources today, are still called UARTs. Transferring data through a UART required a specified set of parallel connections: an interface. What may have seemed at the time a side project, became the most important contributor to computing until the advent of the microchip.</p>

                    <p>By March <strong>1989</strong>, an Apple Macintosh program called HyperCard was two years old, and being tested for a version 2.0 release. At the European nuclear research laboratory CERN, scientists and educators used Macs to write documents and draw diagrams. But all of CERN’s shared assets were stored on a DEC VAX mainframe with the VMS operating system, using a centralized management framework called CERNDOC.</p>
                    <p>Replacing CERNDOC with something that worked like a Mac word processor, would never be an option. So one of CERN’s physicists — a veteran of HyperCard, as well as a document database called Enquire and a game called simply “Adventure” — floated a document proposing that references to CERNDOC’s hierarchy could be embedded in the documents themselves. This way, selecting a reference would immediately bring up the document being referred to. Borrowing a term coined in 1963 by sociologist Ted Nelson — “hypertext” — Tim Berners-Lee humbly suggested, to anyone who was interested, that he could make document retrieval both faster and more efficient by decentralizing its indexing, and by making the server and client, or “browser,” separate programs. He described the interconnection between documents with the terms “mesh” and “web,” but the second one caught on.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 1960s, the essential business of the National Security Agency was encrypting communications. As long as computers remained the sacrosanct property of a privileged few companies, sensitive data could be protected simply by virtue of its own obscurity.</p>
                    <p>In 1982, the three creators of the RSA algorithm formed RSA Security — a commercial endeavor dedicated not to breaking the NSA, but rather ensuring the NSA did not break the public’s right to privacy. But RSA was soon portrayed as a counter-culture company, and even a threat to the government. For commercial cryptography to succeed as a product, it needed a product man. So RSA cryptographer Whitfield Diffie courted Paradyne veteran James Bidzos.</p>
                    <p>By 1986, Bidzos had been elevated to President and CEO of RSA. In 1994, when the U.S. Government began promoting encryption hardware called the “Clipper Chip” with a built-in back door for investigators, Bidzos took a strong stand against it. Yet rather than declaring the NSA the company’s enemy, he portrayed the agency as having declared war against fair commerce, in a public relations battle that RSA won — and surprisingly soon. Then in <strong>1995</strong>, with RSA’s blessing, Bidzos founded the first commercial authentication certificate firm, Verisign.</p>

                    <p>For several years, a single American magazine — <em>Computer Shopper</em> — provided the principal point of contact for an entire segment of the PC industry: direct sales. But during the late 1990s, that fact changed as most of the magazine’s advertisers, led by Dell Computer, deployed working Web sites that presented users with interactive catalogs, and took orders directly from them, bypassing telephones and product codes. Dell had already revolutionized direct sales, and was planning to do so again.</p>
                    <p>By <strong>1998</strong>, David Boucher had already spent 28 years at IBM, the previous 15 of which building the company’s sales and distribution channel. For IBM to reclaim the lead in PCs and forestall a Web effort that Michael Dell had already pre-announced, Boucher championed an Advanced Fulfillment Initiative (AFI) that, to be effective, would radically alter the design of the IBM chassis. Through AFI, customers would order IBM PCs online. The company’s existing channel of resellers would become regional manufacturers, assembling parts to order using a “Snap” model according to customers’ preferences.</p>
                    <p>There were mixed results, and some resellers complained about manufacturing and other costs being transferred to them from IBM. But the move arguably revived the PC brand.</p>

                    <p>It was <strong>1984</strong>, and Apple had just introduced Macintosh. Although the Apple II personal computer established the brand’s place in the office well before IBM, the Apple III flopped badly, and the Lisa was too expensive. So the Mac had an uphill battle ahead. To its disadvantage, it was underpowered and lacked software.</p>
                    <p>The year before, Paul Brainerd was working with a company called Atex, where he co-developed graphical terminals for pre-press editing and typesetting. But it had just been purchased by Kodak, along with his own stock in the company. With only a six-digit sum for capital, Brainerd figured the way to raise capital quickly would be to sell VCs on a kind of “convergence” idea that brought together the Mac’s graphics and Apple’s LaserWriter printer in an office setting. His theme was “desktop publishing.”</p>
                    <p>And Brainerd was rejected, so he approached some Apple employees — not the company directly — who introduced him to Adobe’s John Warnock, the creator of PostScript. With the employees’ help, he demonstrated to Apple a prototype of PageMaker, which used Atex methods to typeset PostScript for Macs. It was the Mac’s first “killer app,” and it did not come from Apple.</p>

                    <p>He wanted to build a calculating device, with a screen that projected a grid, and a shiny, red ball that directed the pointer on that grid. In the meantime, Dan Bricklin thought, he’d prototype the idea of the program on one of those microcomputers that he saw folks at Harvard Business School installing on their TVs. The finance professor there pointed Bricklin to a student named Dan Fylstra, who loaned him an Apple II for a weekend.</p>
                    <p>One weekend in <strong>1978</strong> was all he needed to produce a demo — albeit slow — of a program where arithmetic functions were embedded in cells in a grid that carried numbers. The name “spreadsheet” probably sprouted forth organically, like a happy accident. What it would become was the first modern application. With coding partner and fellow Harvard student Bob Frankston, Bricklin would produce the first modern computer application — the first program designed to wait for input, receive it at the user’s discretion, and react with results. By 1979, VisiCalc would become the premiere product of Fylstra’s company, Personal Software — not Apple or Radio Shack or Commodore, but an independent firm. The software industry started here.</p>

                    <p>For a good part of the 20th century, a significant share of the world’s research in human interaction with technology was conducted by Xerox. Much of it led to the publication of reports. Some of it, like the Palo Alto Research Center’s studies of the sociology of workplaces, produced the graphical computing concepts that Apple copied for its Macintosh.</p>
                    <p>But some 17 years after he proposed PARC to Xerox, with the promise that it would not produce business value in five years’ time but it certainly would in ten, Xerox Chief Scientist John Seely Brown produced something of true value. It was a concept for computer-based diagnosis of systems based on his team’s observation of the learning patterns of elementary school kids.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1986</strong>, Brown’s BUGGY project conducted analytics on the errors these kids were making on math quizzes. It concluded there were patterns behind these errors, and that it was possible to identify their sources. Today, Brown’s research is being applied to new endeavors in machine learning, applying a remedial approach to isolating the factors that lead systems to draw inaccurate conclusions.</p>

                    <p>The first non-IBM PCs capable of running MS-DOS and all of its associated software were generally known as “PC clones.” In the winter of 1981, a handful of companies — some established, some startups — came separately to the conclusion that it was theoretically possible to engineer a computer capable of running MS-DOS without copying IBM’s intellectual property. Of course, IBM was likely to challenge them anyway, but if they were legally in the right, perhaps they could afford to weather the storm.</p>
                    <p>Rod Canion didn’t want simply to produce another PC clone, as Columbia Data products and Texas Instruments — his old employer — were already doing. In January 1982, as two other fellow TI compatriots, Jim Harris and Bill Murto, joined Canion in sketching their ideas on the back of a restaurant place mat, before long their sketch included a handle. They decided to make a PC that was smaller, more portable, yet more durable than an IBM PC, while at the same time providing a customer commitment to 100% compatibility.</p>
                    <p>What developed from this discussion was the genus for a portable computer that justified its premium price tag — over $3,500. Together, they introduced the first Compaq Portable in November <strong>1982</strong>.</p>

                    <p>At a hotel conference area in Washington, D.C., on October 24, <strong>1972</strong>, the consulting firm of Bolt Baranek and Newman had pulled off a brilliant demonstration of packet switching using (by most eyewitness accounts) three computers. Assisting BBN as principal programmer was a 29-year old with a freshly minted Ph.D. from UCLA, on loan from IBM, named Vint Cerf.</p>
                    <p>Programmers like to think aloud, but good programmers speak softly. It was during this conference that Cerf was overheard softly making overtures about the concept of devices that could connect networks. He called these in-between points “interconnects,” and he was overheard having dubbed the network that bridged these points an “internet.”</p>
                    <p>That day, the people most interested in this idea formed an official organization: the International Packet Network Working Group. Without objection, Cerf was immediately elected its chairman. The following June, Cerf led an international seminar, from which he and his fellow participants would produce <em>A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication</em>, published by the IEEE in May 1974. It established the prototype for <em>Transport Control Protocol</em>. Today, TCP is the essential instruction manual for how the Internet works, and will always work.</p>

                    <p>It was December <strong>1998</strong>. Don Listwin, an executive vice president at Cisco Systems, chaired a company presentation. Among those present were the vice president of marketing and the CEO, John Chambers, in his third year at the helm. Still the new man, Chambers was already on record as projecting a total network industry convergence around Internet Protocol, at the heart of Cisco’s router production business.</p>
                    <p>Listwin’s presentation included several references to the phrase “new world.” Eyewitnesses say Chambers not only adopted the phrase immediately, but began referring to technologies and competitor vendors belonging to the “old world.” It was here that Chambers would begin the process of assembling a “New Internet Ecosystem,” based not just on Cisco’s existing pattern of acquisitions, but partnering with well-known suppliers and technology providers.</p>
                    <p>Just two months later, Cisco and Motorola would launch the ecosystem in a joint announcement. Though their partnership lasted little more than a year, the launch quickly built momentum for Cisco, vanquishing competitors Nortel Networks and Cabletron, and initiating the process that sublimated the Lucent brand into an acquisition of an acquisition. That these competitors would cease to exist was a prediction made almost solely by Chambers.</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 1979, a team of engineers who built hardware prototypes for Xerox’ PARC research center, gave an extended demonstration of how to custom-build semiconductors, for some of the faculty of Stanford University. One of them was Lynn Conway, who had co-created the Mead-Conway method for Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). In the room was a researcher and professor named James H. Clark, who was immediately taken with Conway’s method.</p>
                    <p>Within months, Clark would write and publish articles about his epiphany. VLSI, he believed, would be an inexpensive way of producing very fast parallelism — executing sequences of instructions over very large spans of input data. Only through parallelism, he demonstrated, could computers render detailed graphics in real-time to be used for real-world situations, such as architectural modeling. Clark was inspired by how VLSI was already being put to use producing arithmetic logic units (ALUs) for smaller and smaller computers.</p>
                    <p>Obviously Clark invented the graphics processor as we know it today. But that invention would be a patent on a shelf if he had not also founded in <strong>1982</strong> the business that first produced the thing. Invoking a title that explained itself, he dubbed his venture Silicon Graphics.</p>

                    <p>It was the sort of paper whose subject matter was enough to convey the identity of its publisher: IBM. Its subject was the growing problem of maintaining continuity among associated elements of data. In the 1950s, that task was simple: You made certain all the punch cards were in the right box. By <strong>1969</strong>, magnetic media was taking over, and data had to be kept organized in software.</p>
                    <p>Though the first four words in the paper’s title were “Derivability, Redundancy, and Consistency,” it would come to be known by the title of the first section, “A Relational View of Data.” Its author was “E. F. Codd, Research Division, San Jose, California.” Codd would perfect this “view” the following year, for a 1970 paper for the ACM that presented the “Relational Model.” There, he introduced the computing world to two mathematical concepts that had, heretofore, not applied to it: first-order predicate logic, and the theory of relations. A relation, as he explained it, was an unordered set of tuples to which organization may be applied later. A practical way to apply that organization was with a language, which Codd also created: Structured Query Language (SQL), at the heart of relational databases.</p>

                    <p>The company was calling itself Palm Computing, though few people knew it in <strong>1995</strong>. It was participating in the production of a handheld device it created, that Palm called the Zoomer. But the major brands that stamped their name on the device all changed it to something else: AST GRiDpad 2390, Casio Z-7000, Tandy Z-PDA. It was a time when manufacturers believed alphanumerics sold technology to consumers.</p>
                    <p>So the company’s vice president of marketing, Ed Colligan — who, just a few years ago, had led marketing for a producer of Macintosh accelerator cards — laid the groundwork for a change of plan. It would involve a new device that would change the focus from what the device did, to what you did with the device. Rather than wait for Tandy or Casio to wedge space for it in some catalog, Palm would present an image of a more powerful user, not just powerful tech with letters and digits. Its marketing campaign centered around how the device made the user feel, and the role she played in using it. It was the Pilot, and its marketing was the prototype for nearly every mobile device that followed.</p>

                    <p>Signe Ostby deserves a lot of credit. In <strong>1983</strong>, she somehow inspired her husband, then a marketing manager with Procter &amp; Gamble, to do whatever he could to make one of those devices sit on her kitchen table and balance their family checkbook. Husband Scott was so inspired by Signe’s heartfelt plea (so the stories say) that he copied off notices for Stanford students, seeking a programmer. For a dual graduate of Harvard and USC, you can imagine how inspired Scott Cook must have been.</p>
                    <p>Cook asked a student, Tom Proulx, where the bulletin boards were located — the cork kind, not the kind with modems. Tom, as it so happened, had an Apple II in his dorm room. It was not the early days of the software industry; VisiCalc had been created five years earlier, and the Macintosh would make its premiere only months later. But Cook and Proulx imagined that, if they could build a program by testing it out with experimental users first, and use those tests to write a manual in everyday language, they’d have a unique business case. Together, they created Quicken — in a few years’ time, the world’s best-selling program.</p>

                    <p>In the late 1970s, the first network of authorized Apple II resellers was comprised mainly of boutique stores. Once those boutiques consolidated into the first chains, many of them obtained IBM certification. To stay competitive against IBM, the boutiques signed on with Compaq, one of the few “PC-compatible” brands that could go toe-to-toe against IBM on quality.</p>
                    <p>Compaq had eked out a leadership position with major businesses with its early boutique strategy. But to expand its market, it needed to attract individuals and smaller businesses through deals with major retailers. In <strong>1992</strong>, Ross Cooley, Compaq’s senior executive vice president for North America, was among the first to appreciate the irony of the situation. After hiring Michael Norris from a Japanese fax machine distributor to be Compaq’s Vice President for Consumer Products, Cooley championed an effort to produce two new PC lines – Contura notebook PCs and Prolinea desktops – targeted to consumers and smaller businesses. These were meant to be purchased in bulk, by major retailers such as CompUSA, Circuit City, Office Depot, BizMart, and Computer City. Cooley’s strategy kept Compaq in high demand for the remainder of the decade.</p>

                    <p>In a House of Pies restaurant on Westheimer Road in Houston, Texas, in <strong>1982</strong>, three fellows who had just left senior management posts at Texas Instruments were meeting up with a prospective venture capitalist. Rod Canion, Jim Harris, and Bill Murto were explaining to Ben Rosen their vision for a computer that could compete head-on with the IBM PC. In an era before PowerPoint, they found themselves sketching their prototype for Rosen on the back of a paper placemat.</p>
                    <p>Its keyboard would clamp onto the front of the system, protecting its monitor and two floppy disk drives while it was carried from place to place, such as from home to work and back. In 1982, no one carried a computer along with them, let alone run it on his lap. For an owner to want to carry a computer home, it would need to run all the software it ran at work, not just most of it. So they insisted upon reverse-engineering the IBM PC, as only they could. The Compaq Portable PC would be produced the following year. Though not the first portable computer, it was the first fully compatible model with IBM that could also compete in performance.</p>

                    <p>What became one of America’s first and largest resellers of computer equipment to large enterprises — and, as a result, the firm that introduced the local area network to an eager new market — began as a result of an epiphany shared over tall beers at an Irish pub in Chicago called Butch McGuire’s, in <strong>1977</strong>. There, a fellow named Phil Corcoran, whose job at the time was managing the distribution of blank cassette tapes from Memorex to office supplies distributors, presented his college buddy Chuck Wolande with some facts and figures showing they could make more money distributing Memorex tapes than managing their distribution. Wolande — by his own admission, not all that good with math — bought into it.</p>
                    <p>They named their tape distribution venture Communications Marketing, and soon learned they could make a killing through distributing most anything to major offices, including these new, fancy computers. Since they didn’t actually resell PBX systems, though, they wisely shortened the name to Comark. As an efficient distributor and reseller, Corcoran and Wolande soon became some of IBM’s and HP’s most relied upon sales partners. Many say they created the computer sales channel for businesses, or at the very least, prototyped it.</p>

                    <p>The computer Dave Cutler wanted to build was called Prism. It was a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) that Digital Equipment Corp. believed would champion the architecture that would save the company, and that would certainly replace machines based on its venerable VAX operating system. But the people who built computers were not perceived as programmers, even though Cutler and his colleagues would have founded the architecture upon which Prism relied.</p>
                    <p>It was June <strong>1988</strong>. In a cost-cutting move, DEC laid off most of its hardware team who reported to Cutler. Desperately depressed and furious, Cutler immediately departed DEC for Microsoft. Without even asking them, many of his old DEC team followed. At Microsoft, they repurposed their RISC operating system for an experimental hardware design based on an Intel RISC chip called the 80860. Cutler would discover the chip was flawed, and the team was forced to repurpose the OS yet again. Determined to find a purpose for it, Cutler essentially remade his OS into a new rendition of Windows. It worked so well that Bill Gates would charge Cutler with rebuilding it into Windows NT, the company’s next-generation operating system whose architecture remains at the heart of Windows today.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, new classes of software were not yet determined by the marketplace. In an era where few entities, private or public, actually owned and operated their own computers, even fewer understood enough about how they worked to know what a class of software might look like. So it was in this environment of academic experimentation that a 1969 paper on database relations by IBM’s Edgar F. Codd, which IBM considered something of a “firestorm” at the time, spawned the first effort to explain a practical way to accomplish Codd’s goals by something approaching Codd’s means, in <strong>1975</strong>, in the form of a book.</p>
                    <p>Four years earlier, Codd met with a Cambridge graduate in IBM’s Advanced Technology Department named Chris J. Date, who was immediately taken with Codd’s understated manner. The following year, Date sent Codd a letter of inquiry about his interest in this book. Codd eagerly consented, and began an exchange of correspondence that quickly led to a first draft. As an IBM book, the draft spent three years in editing. But that editing process would trigger an internal debate that led to IBM replacing its existing IMS with a relational system.</p>

                    <p>It was supposed to be a way for a full-time University of Texas at Austin student to earn a little spending money on the side. With what basically counts as pocket change in his savings account, in <strong>1984</strong>, Michael Dell bought the basic parts necessary to build PC-compatible computers in his dorm room. The cool thing about is was he could make them to order. Soon, he incorporated as PCs Limited, and standardized the process of ordering. And almost accidentally, he was making millions.</p>
                    <p>In the era before the Internet was an everyday element of people’s lives, a single magazine — <em>Computer Shopper</em> — answered America’s demand for PCs and parts throughout the 1980s and ‘90s, printing as many as 800 tabloid-sized pages per month. This one publication presented a unique and unrepeatable opportunity for an entrepreneur to use the magazine not only as a product catalog, but as a front for a kind of virtual computer store. Dell placed an ad in the <em>Shopper</em> featuring PCs Limited’s direct-order menu. Almost immediately, he had too many orders for a few people to fulfill. He reincorporated as Dell Computer Corp., started hiring, and started growing. And he has rarely ever stopped.</p>

                    <p>In 1984, Apple Computer promoted Donna Dubinsky to the post of U.S. distribution manager for all products, which included maintaining relationships with all its dealers, including national chains and boutique stores. That year, Apple had introduced Macintosh, whose service and support were dramatically different than for Apple II. By September, Dubinsky and her boss, Roy Weaver, worked out a business plan for maintaining the distribution chain for both product lines through 1985.</p>
                    <p>But Apple President Steve Jobs had just dined with the CEO of Federal Express, Fred Smith, where he learned about its “just-in-time” delivery methodology. Immediately, Jobs wanted to emulate it, with a new manufacturing process that would eliminate all six regional warehouses, moving from a supply-driven to a demand-driven model. At a “Leadership Conference” in April <strong>1985</strong>, she refused to allow her distribution unit to be evaluated by an outside task force, threatening resignation. CEO John Sculley may have thought he was calling her bluff. She made good on her threat, and took her lessons in both product distribution and integrity with her. Together with business partner Jeff Hawkins, she would found Palm and serve as its CEO. Dubinsky would effectively teach Apple two lessons.</p>

                    <p>The date was December 9, <strong>1968</strong>. Within the first ten minutes, Dr. Douglas C. Engelbart had demonstrated a machine with a keyboard, a mouse, and an alternate input device akin to a stenograph. It projected text with a pointer on a character-driven CRT screen, dark text on white, whose view and magnification could be altered with commands. It showed a database whose entries could be navigated from table to table by moving the pointer to a word identified as a link, and tapping the button on the mouse. It accepted programs on the fly using a high-level language that borrowed from English. Those programs were stored in files on a local, 96-megabyte hard disk drive. Absolutely none of these things had ever been publicly demonstrated. Engelbart had brilliantly unveiled the first, true personal computer.</p>

They had studied Radio Shack’s TRS-80, the Apple II, the Commodore 64, and other brands. They were given <em>carte blanche</em> to conceive a strategy that was not tied to existing IBM architecture. So they concluded, if they were a hypothetical company with IBM’s cash flow but that was not IBM, entering the personal computer market that day, they would produce an open architecture PC with a CPU from Intel or Motorola, and an operating system from Microsoft or Digital Research. So the fact that they were IBM, should not alter that strategy. Not everyone at IBM was on board with this idea, but using the IBM PC for the first time changed minds quickly.</p>

                    <p>The Internet could never replace television, many believed, because it was not a broadcast medium. Internet Protocol was explicitly designed to accept packets sent from a source address to a destination address. Besides, the Internet as a pipeline wasn’t capable of shuttling even a handful of standard-definition TV signals at its widest point. The cable TV industry publicly declared the Internet too narrow and uncontrollable to carry television signals, though privately, it was more than a little frightened.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the first attempt to do something like Internet broadcasting that actually worked in Windows took place in <strong>1995</strong>, when Judith Estrin and her research partner Bill Carrico devised a transport system they called IP/TV, for their company, Precept Software. An existing concept called Internet Multicast Backbone, or MBONE, was comprised of a “tunnel” of IP addresses through which a single cascade of live streams was sent. Estrin and Carrico borrowed this principle for a product called StreamWatch, that transmitted DVD-quality streams from Internet servers to Windows-based clients. Right away, they searched for prospective clients. What they found was a very willing new parent: Cisco, which acquired Precept and appointed Estrin its CTO.</p>

                    <p>The growth of the digital publishing industry since the influence of the Web can be compared to the growth of the coral reef under the influence of the tide. The latter clearly led to the former, but it’s difficult to look at a snapshot of any one moment in time, and conceive a viable theory of how.</p>
                    <p>In 1999, Robert Faletra became the Chief Content Officer of CMP Media’s TechWeb. Several of CMP’s classic print publications, including InternetWeek, InformationWeek, EE Times, and CRN, had each been moving online, but each on its own. TechWeb and its brands that started online, such as Planet IT, were garnering readers but failing to funnel many of them toward the transitioning imprints. So Faletra was put in charge of a strategy to make these brands coalesce online — a strategy that meant shutting some of them down. The plan stopped losses, but it didn’t create the growth the company was looking for. So in <strong>2008</strong>, the newly renamed United Business Media split CMP Media into four groups. Faletra became CEO of Everything Channel, which published CRN and addressed the IT sales channel. Five years later, Faletra bought out the firm, creating The Channel Company.</p>

                    <p>In 1977, just two years after Popular Electronics astounded the world by showing garage tinkerers how to build a working Altair computer, Radio Shack produced its first fully-functional, ready-to-run microcomputer that didn’t need a soldering iron. But the first $600 TRS-80 wasn’t really 100% complete, as the only BASIC language it would run could only load programs from cassette tape.</p>
                    <p>Radio Shack had pioneered the “Good / Better / Best” marketing scheme, so it leveraged these scheme to its advantage with TRS-80, producing the “Better” version in March <strong>1978</strong>. That second edition would support an operating system called TRSDOS, and a “Level II BASIC” built to work with a DOS. Parent company Tandy Corp. contracted with Bill Gates (the name of his company wasn’t important then), whose reputation for building Altair’s best BASIC was unmatched. Not only did Gates outdo himself with a world-standard BASIC, but he left “hooks” in his code for a Level III edition — one which Microsoft would soon market through an independent distributor, GRT Corp. Gates’ clever engineering gave Microsoft a tool it could later exploit as a software company, and paved the way for Microsoft to make its 1981 MS-DOS deal with IBM.</p>

                    <p>The first serious research into the real-world implications of an Internet or other network of everyday things, began with investigations into whether people could conduct computing tasks more easily if computing power were distributed throughout various objects in an office or household. A <strong>1998</strong> paper, “Activating Everyday Objects,” brought together two Xerox PARC researchers, Roy Want and Mark Weiser, with a Georgia Tech College of Computing professor named Elizabeth Mynatt.</p>
                    <p>Their research made the case that computers may not become too much easier for people to use, so long as their principal metaphors remain intrinsic to computers rather than the everyday world. If computing power reacted directly to the objects that people touch, handle, and move, they believed application development could become centered around the flow of information, rather than the positioning of mouse pointers and menu bars. Prof. Mynatt was a key research partner with Weiser, a champion of the concept of “ubiquitous computing.” Her role in the research became a key focus of the Georgia Tech Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center, founded in 1991, leading the study of computing and human behavior. She directed the GVU Center for five years, beginning in 2005.</p>

                    <p>In 1977, a Xerox PARC researcher named Dr. Charles Geschke presented a demonstration for about 250 Xerox employees, including senior executives. They had all seen the word processor that showed graphical characters on a high-resolution screen – that wasn’t new. They were already intimate with the mouse, although it wouldn’t premiere with Apple Lisa for another six years. What was so important that 250-plus execs should be dragged to this meeting, concerned the printer: Geschke could typeset a document on-screen, make adjustments there, and produce an exact duplicate on a Xerox printer.</p>
                    <p>Xerox loved the idea so much that it trimmed its production schedule down to a mere seven years, from what might have been ten. But by <strong>1982</strong>, it was clear to Geschke that Xerox hadn’t completed year one of the plan. So together with another fellow he hired named John Warnock, he left Xerox and devised a business plan for a new printer and computer company. But both Gordon Bell at DEC and Steve Jobs at Apple advised them that the software would be more valuable than another computer and another printer. With a 20% investment from Apple, Geschke and Warnock formed a software company: Adobe Systems.</p>

                    <p>The phrase was “universal service,” and today it still appears on many Americans’ telephone bills. In 1909, AT&amp;T President Theodore Vail had invoked this phrase as a corporate slogan, arguing that there should naturally be only one “nervous system” linking American businesses — the Bell System — and for decades, Congress agreed. The ideal of an ordained “natural monopoly” began breaking down when businesspeople first proposed that new communications services outside AT&amp;T’s domain were not subject to the monopoly rule — people who were skillful enough to change their argument over time, to challenge AT&amp;T’s natural domain.</p>
                    <p>The first long, sustained challenge began in <strong>1963</strong>, when Jack Goeken petitioned Federal Communications Commission for a microwave communications line extending from Chicago to St. Louis. He said it would be for the trucking industry. AT&amp;T challenged the petition, but over time, MCI prevailed. And then Goeken pivoted: If microwave relays worked for truckers’ communications, why not for everyday people? And why not for computer data? MCI’s argument evolved into a full-on federal lawsuit in 1974. The outcome of that lawsuit would be nothing less than the dissolution of the AT&amp;T monopoly, without which there could be no Internet.</p>

                    <p>Xerox Corp. had just spent 92 times the annual earnings of Scientific Data Systems in the act of acquiring it. So CEO Charles McCullough needed to assure shareholders the purchase was justified. His senior vice president for R&amp;D, Jack Goldman, had already spent one career directing a scientific research laboratory, producing a workable concept for a company that would never make use of it: specifically, superconductivity for Ford Motor Company. At exactly the right time in <strong>1969</strong>, Goldman put forth his idea for a second career: leading a high-class scientific research lab. McCullough was not in a position to say no.</p>
                    <p>To staff this lab, Goldman’s first major hire was George Pake, then a member of President Johnson’s scientific advisory committee. Pake observed that there had never been, until that time, a research institution linking the fields of computer science and technology. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center officially opened on July 1, 1970. Pake would hire the most brilliant minds in research not only to conceive, but also build and program, working prototype computers. The idea that the processors of computers could reside in cooled boxes in the vicinity of workers’ desktops, was conceived and produced at PARC.</p>

                    <p>At the start of the 1960s, a statistical regression function was something one programmed into a computer each time, using whatever language was best suited to the computer at the time. This became a portability problem for anybody who owned multiple computers – for example, the Pentagon. In 1965, a programmer who had been studying oceanography named Tony Barr realized that if he created a configuration file, he could effectively use the regression analysis engine as a kind of compiler, accepting each file as input.</p>
                    <p>In June 1966, Barr returned to his alma mater, North Carolina State University. There he met Jim Goodnight, who heard his ideas for a Statistical Analysis System. Goodnight evolved Barr’s idea into a broader, commercial strategy. By <strong>1968</strong>, they had a working model. From there, they split the work: Barr developed the regression language, and Goodnight would build the routines that would make the program appeal to different industry sectors, public and private. For the next four years, SAS was a kind of “private beta” for the first modern statistical application, managed by Goodnight, Barr, and two other NC State partners. In 1972, SAS was the foundation for the world’s largest private software firm.</p>

                    <p>András Gróf built his life around escaping tragedy and building anew. At age 20, he fled the Soviet invasion of Hungary into Austria, where he found safe passage to America. There, first as a chemist, the newly christened Andrew Grove found his way into the laboratory of the semiconductor’s creator, William Shockley. But in an environment where he and his colleagues were demeaned, Grove followed Sherman Fairchild to help create Fairchild Semiconductor. Then in 1968, stymied by Fairchild’s incapability to innovate, Grove, Robert Noyce, and Gordon Moore escaped again, and founded Intel.</p>
                    <p>But they had to prove it was worth it. Though Moore is credited with popularizing the idea of microprocessor evolution, it was Grove who, in <strong>1970</strong>, led the research team that would codify the refinement of metal oxide semiconductors as a design principle. That year, Intel produced the 1103 — the world’s first generally available DRAM chip, with 1K of address space. What Intel truly produced that year, however, was “square one:” a procedure for continually refining the manufacturing process so that newer and better chips were always in the works. Andy Grove automated the process of escaping the past into a brighter day.</p>

                    <p>It was 21 years before Apple would introduce the iPad. In <strong>1989</strong>, a former instructor in process technology at Intel’s education facilities, named Jeff Hawkins, was working for GRiD — the company credited with producing the world’s first clamshell laptop computer. For a follow-up act, GRiD was planning a tablet: the GRiDPad. For users to accept it as a tablet, Hawkins believed, the device needed to interpret human handwriting.</p>
                    <p>Hawkins was uniquely suited for this task. Throughout his academic studies and even as a teacher himself, he intensely pursued computer science and neuroscience. Knowing that no great computer succeeded without a “killer app,” Hawkins wrote the program intended to define the GRiDPad in the public mind, and make the user accept it as a personal tool. It was called PalmPrint. It was an algorithmic way of accepting input from a pen that was pretty much, though not exactly, like handwriting, and interpreting that more accurately than if it had been actual handwriting. The smartest thing Hawkins did was patent PalmPrint under his own name. Though GRiD did not live on as a brand, PalmPrint did, becoming the handwriting system for the Zoomer PDA and, after that, the Palm Pilot.</p>

Hayes and Heatherington took orders by the dozens, and the Club would use their modems to operate a bulletin board service by telephone. They published their phone number in Byte, one of the highest circulating magazines of the day. In just two years’ time, the two partners would conceive, test, and produce a new class of modem hardware that used the faster RS-232 serial interface, and that responded directly to signals from their host computers: the Hayes command set.

                    <p>In 1985, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission issued a breakthrough ruling, with regard to the use of the public airwaves to transmit data. Up until that point, a wireless data device was considered a radio like any other, for the purposes of spectrum allocation. Your device had a set of designated channels, like a TV set, and it stayed within those boundaries. After the ruling, devices could employ spread spectrum — allowing portions of a signal to be distributed across frequency bands.</p>
                    <p>One of the companies that wanted to exploit this capability right away was NCR, which foresaw opportunities for wireless, electronic cash registers. This time, NCR believed it would be foolish to wait for IBM to set the standard for everyone else to follow. So in 1988, a group of NCR engineers including Victor Hayes set about to develop a working framework for spread spectrum wireless devices. Then in <strong>1990</strong>, NCR commissioned Hayes to petition the IEEE to initiate working group 802.11, to make its framework an international standard, forestalling IBM. Hayes says he was surprised his peers wanted him to lead the group. After seven years of debate, 802.11 published the standard that, today, we call Wi-Fi.</p>

                    <p>What Bill Hewlett made first was an audio oscillator. Literally, it was a box that emitted a pure tone produced from a sine wave. Hewlett wasn’t really inventing anything here; the Wein Bridge circuit on which this box was based, was created in 1891. But in <strong>1939</strong>, as the Great Depression was at its climax, if anyone needed an oscillator, it had to be one that was cheap but practical. Hewlett achieved this by using an ordinary light bulb as a more-than-efficient amplitude stabilizer.</p>
                    <p>Yes, Hewlett and business partner David Packard would produce these oscillators from his own garage in Palo Alto. They went in on a Sears-Roebuck drill press together, with some of the $538 they amassed in operating capital. Packard named the device the “200A,” for no other reason than he thought it sounded distinguished. Packard also set the retail price at $5.40, after Pres. James K. Polk’s 1844 campaign slogan “54-40 or fight!” except divided by 10 because $54.40 would have been cost-prohibitive. Hewlett and Packard really didn’t have all that much of a plan. But they shared a garage, a piggy bank, and a dream, all of which was enough to build HP.</p>

In 1991, a fellow working on a pen computing project named Mike Malcolm had a similar idea, with respect to storage: Why not produce a cheap computer whose only purpose was to store data on a large, expandable array — a “Cisco for storage?” With pen computing decades away, Malcolm approached two former colleagues, Dave Hitz and James Lau, with a proposal for a new company.</p>
                    <p>Hitz and Lau were busy starting up a software firm, because with little capital, software was pretty much what you could do. Early investors thought their idea lacked direction. So with the pocket change they were able to scrounge up, Hitz and Lau developed the underlying file server for Malcolm’s platform, giving it the mandatorily cute acronym WAFL — Write Anywhere File Layout. WAFL had the unique ability to present read-only snapshots of past images of an entire file system — earning Lau and Hitz a U.S. patent. In <strong>1992</strong>, that patent caught the attention of Gordon Bell, who made the investment that gave rise to Network Appliance — known today as NetApp.</p>

                    <p>Until her retirement in 1986, Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was the highest-ranking woman in the U.S. Navy’s history — a rear admiral. Her greatest accomplishments to society may have come from her devotion to the ideal of “leadership training,” which included teaching children the basic principles of electrical engineering. For example, she’d hand out finger-length strands of copper wire and call them “nanoseconds,” representing the length traveled by an electron in one nanosecond.</p>
                    <p>Adm. Hopper’s contribution to our industry is foundational, however. She gave us the principal software development tool, the compiler — it was her idea. The notion that a computer should accept its instructions in a language other than its own, that resembled written human language instead, was championed by Hopper. Although men took credit for that idea, research reveals her humility in never having challenged them. Indeed, she described the inspiring force behind her creation of the first working “Flow-Matic” compiler in <strong>1952</strong> as her own “laziness.” But she wasn’t lazy while she defended her idea even while men, observing it actually working, argued that it wasn’t really happening. While they squabbled, Hopper improved Flow-Matic until in 1959, it could compile her own Common Business Oriented Language — COBOL.</p>

                    <p>In 2001, in one of the most controversial moves of its history even today, HP acquired Compaq. From the consumer PC perspective, it meant the most recognized brand in competing against IBM in PC compatibles became absorbed into the brand most associated with printers. In the emerging data center, it meant the company that rescued Tandem Computers and its venerable NonStop brand, was itself being rescued by a bigger company with an all-in stake in Itanium, a processor technology that, at that time, wasn’t compatible with NonStop’s timing mechanisms.</p>
                    <p>It was already something of a mess. And when HP made the decision in 2002 to follow Dell’s lead in selling PCs directly to businesses, arguably the company most impacted by this decision was Synnex, one of the most powerful brands in the supply chain and HP’s 2001 “Top Growth Distributor of the Year.” As a result, Synnex CEO Bob Huang scrambled. In a catch-up move against leading competitor Ingram Micro, Huang instigated the acquisition of distribution competitor Merisel. That put Synnex on better footing to launch an IPO in <strong>2003</strong>. Huang rephrased a significant industry downturn as a growth prospect, in the move many regard as saving the channel.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 1970s, the major computer manufacturers did not regard the embryonic personal computer business as an emerging threat to their industry until the revenue chain started taking shape. Boutique stores were the first retailers to establish the brand presence of Apple, Commodore, Atari, and the brands that have since faded into history: Amstrad, Ohio Scientific, Exidy, and Apricot. Before many of these stores consolidated into chains, they began sharing names, perhaps unintentionally. There were “Computer Mart” stores across America and Canada before there was a Computer Mart chain.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1976</strong>, one of those stores named Computer Mart in Royal Oak, Michigan was being run by Joseph Inatome, along with his son Rick as manager. They saw the advantage of name recognition, so they began acquiring and consolidating as many as 15 Computer Mart and Computer City stores, collectively under Rick’s leadership. Studying the success of his group’s advertising, Rick realized that consumers invested their trust in stores before they’d invest it in brands. He began a cooperative advertising scheme, which soon expanded into a big part of the burgeoning PC sales channel — a part that soon took on the name Inacom Corp.</p>

                    <p>In the era when software was delivered in shrink-wrapped boxes with dozens of floppy diskettes and bound manuals, the Ingram name was synonymous with software distribution. Customers whose small and medium businesses relied upon boutique and chain computer stores, became so familiar with the software distribution channel that, once a magazine positively reviewed a product, they’d call the store and ask, “When will Ingram ship it to you?” Just as Billboard produced its Top 20 popular songs chart, throughout the 1980s and ‘90s, the “Ingram Micro D List” told buyers what software titles were popular, and which were the likeliest to get discounted.</p>
                    <p>The forerunner of Ingram Industries started out in 1938 as a Tennessee oil company. In the 1940s, they began a distribution business that operated some 1,800 river barges. When it took to the highways, under the leadership of Erskine Bronson Ingram, the family firm began distributing books. It entered the software distribution business on the side in 1982, which made it a contender. But it was the <strong>1985</strong> merger with Micro D that gave Ingram the “List,” and made it the world’s leading independent distributor of computers and software.</p>

                    <p>Toward the end of the 1980s, PCs were running out of memory. A byte was only 16 binary digits wide, and both data and address busses were only one byte wide, limiting addressable memory to the breadth of the memory map. The solution, PC enthusiasts knew, would be a 32-bit address bus. But IBM wanted to control the 32-bit market, as well as the hardware that attached to it. So while IBM produced its first PS/2 computers with Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), Compaq competed with a completely different 32-bit architecture called EISA, that it shared with other manufacturers in hopes of building a standard.</p>
                    <p>At first, Intel treated this as a win/win for itself. But with MCA carrying stiff royalties, and EISA requiring new manufacturing techniques, 32-bit PCs became too expensive, and customers were sticking with their 286-based AT-compatibles. So Intel’s Andrew Grove put engineer Dennis Carter in charge of producing a stopgap solution. In 1988, Carter’s team produced the 386SX processor with a 32-bit data bus, but a 16-bit address bus compatible with existing AT architectures. Not only would Carter’s 386SX sell millions of units, but the entire PC market surged, effectively terminating further production for both 32-bit architectures.</p>

                    <p>The Macintosh 512K, produced by Apple in September <strong>1984</strong>, is in many ways Steve Jobs’ greatest computer success. But Jobs was led to this success, sometimes literally kicking and screaming, by his own engineers.</p>
                    <p>In 1979, an Apple research team was experimenting with entering the minicomputer market against IBM, DEC, and Data General. Elsewhere in the same building, engineers Jef Raskin and Bill Atkinson developed a concept for a small, self-contained, box-shaped computer that would replace the failed Apple III. Having spent time at Xerox PARC, Raskin believed the system should be graphical, even though he wasn’t sold on the mouse.</p>
                    <p>Jobs dismissed Raskin’s idea, at least at first, until Raskin convinced him to visit PARC himself. It took two visits, as Raskin recalls, for Jobs to get a complete handle on what he was seeing: graphical screens used to typeset documents that looked proportionally identical when printed. Jobs loved the mouse, though. So he scrapped the software originally intended for the minicomputer, replaced it with Raskin’s platform, and dubbed the new project Lisa. Lisa’s launch failed in 1981, and the first February 1984 Macintosh launch was troubled. With Mac 512 that September, history reveals, Jobs got this one right.</p>

                    <p>Sun Microsystems originally wanted to be in the networking business. Its co-founder, Bill Joy, was already the principal author of Berkeley UNIX, and the principal contributor to Network File System. But Sun wasn’t entirely certain what it wanted to produce going forward, and by 1989, Joy wasn’t sure he wanted to stay with Sun. He moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he revived an old project of his: a kind of object-oriented programming language based on C and C++, but more portable, borrowing ideas from a Xerox PARC project called Mesa.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile in Santa Clara, Sun scientist James Gosling was being tasked with the job of conceiving a use case for any consumer device that could use Sun technology. At one point, Sun chief Scott McNealy was set on a combination PDA / remote control, but by 1991, he was leaning toward an operating system for a cable TV set-top box. After Time Warner rejected Sun’s proposal, Joy suggested to Gosling, why not rebuild his software into a stand-alone language like the one he proposed over a decade ago? Gosling’s prototype was dubbed Oak, but before it was demonstrated to Netscape in <strong>1994</strong>, Sun wisely renamed it Java.</p>

                    <p>Microsoft became a globally recognized brand by virtue of its appearance in the copyright notice when users booted their PCs and started MS-DOS. Borland International became a contender against Microsoft in the development tools space by virtue of the unorthodox market strategy set forth by its well-spoken, sometimes sporadically philosophical, CEO, Phillipe Kahn.</p>
                    <p>The first microcomputers were shipped with the BASIC programming language as part of their on-board ROMs. Indeed, many of the first IBM PCs actually included a working BASIC interpreter – in the case of PC-DOS, two interpreters when you count Advanced BASIC (BASICA). But as packaged applications surpassed do-it-yourself programming in popularity, the first consumer-grade development tools were typically cost prohibitive. Kahn disrupted this market situation in 1983 by offering Turbo Pascal – a genuine, high-performance language compiler by Anders Hejlsberg – as a shrink-wrapped manual with a diskette and a $49.95 street price. But Kahn cemented his company’s market position in <strong>1987</strong> by offering Turbo Basic – a compiler for BASICA code – at the same price, taking on Microsoft’s line of BASIC compilers, the cheapest of which (QuickBasic) sold for twice as much. Kahn tied Microsoft’s hands up until the release of version 3.0 in 1990.</p>

                    <p>The program’s name was “Tiny Troll.” The reason Mitch Kapor, a former radio station program manager and disk jockey, gave it that name, was not obvious. Mathematicians at MIT in the 1960s used to produce economic models on a timesharing system called TROLL; Kapor wanted to do something reminiscent of that on his Apple II in 1978. It was a successful enough project that Software Arts, which produced VisiCalc – the first spreadsheet – hired Kapor to produce companion products called VisiPlot and VisiTrend.</p>
                    <p>But the newly redubbed VisiCorp hadn’t planned on growing as fast as it did, and Kapor soon wanted out. He had befriended a colleague and fellow programmer named Jonathan Sachs, who had developed a program cleverly disguised as a “graphical calculator” but which was clearly a spreadsheet. In <strong>1981</strong>, VisiCorp agreed to buy out Kapor’s contract, stipulating a non-compete clause, but leaving open an exception that enabled him to produce Sachs’ idea, which the two had already started six months earlier on the less constrained 64K IBM PC. At first, Kapor insisted it wouldn’t be a spreadsheet. Certainly its name “1-2-3” was as self-definitive as “Tiny Troll.” But when it shipped in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 made history anyway.</p>

                    <p>Typography was never a factor in the display of the computers that people use every day until Apple freed the ideal of what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) from the confines of Xerox’ PARC laboratory, which had held onto it for over a decade. Apple had produced its Lisa computer in 1981, but its “graphical metaphor” was confusing – including tearing paper off a pad and stamping an application onto it, to open a word processor.</p>
                    <p>Andy Hertzfeld, who led the development of Macintosh system software, was also on the Lisa team, and understood the confusing metaphor first-hand. Hertzfeld believed that may of the Mac’s visual concepts could be made clearer if they were approached by a graphic designer, rather than a squadron of software developers. He happened to know one: literally a childhood friend, Susan Kare, who at the time was working in a museum and studying to be a teacher. In <strong>1983</strong>, Kare planned the Mac’s icons the way an advertising creative team approached the problem of designing a logo for a corporation, multiplied by hundreds. She drew iconic icons – symbols that were instantly associated with concepts, rather than just cute symbols. Today, Mac veterans recall Kare’s icons as emblematic of an era.</p>

                    <p>Not all great accomplishments in computing took place in a spirit of glory, good cheer, and celebration. PKWare Inc. became a profitable concern because one man, Phil Katz (the “PK” in the title), was a particularly effective programmer of a tool that the emerging online user desperately needed: a mathematical compressor for software packages distributed online.</p>
                    <p>Compressing the number of bytes consumed by a file is usually accomplished with an algorithm that replaces repeated sequences of bytes with symbols that are shorter than the sequences themselves. The first popular algorithm for that purpose was ARC, and Katz produced a machine language version for PCs that ran blazingly fast. But in an era before open source was a viable option for commercial coders, the ARC formula had been patented, and Katz was sued. He responded by switching formulas, though Lempel-Ziv (the latter syllable having been referred to colloquially as “Zip”) was also patented. Katz’ PKZIP was even more popular, but after a new round of legal battles, he ended up developing his own “ZIP” compression format in <strong>1989</strong>. Katz was one of the most successful self-made businessmen in computing, until a competitor ironically appropriated his format in 1991.</p>

                    <p>Pretty much the moment that Alan Kay was asked to consult for Xerox’ establishment of its unnamed computer laboratory in 1970, he began assembling his notes describing his concept for a computer for kids. A computer at the end of the 1960s was not quite for adults, so many folks at Xerox considered Kay’s idea ludicrous. But if a child could not only learn to use a computer but want to, Kay argued, imagining any adult using it could become child’s play.</p>
                    <p>PARC’s purpose soon became to build prototypes, and in 1971, Kay had developed his “kiddicomp” into a concept for a portable computer called “miniCOM.” In <strong>1972</strong>, Kay’s colleague, Butler Lampson, approached him with a challenge: He wanted to build his prototype for a $500 minicomputer in three months. Could Kay build his miniCOM language for it? Without revealing he was already far along with the project, Kay upped the ante by boasting he could write his language in one page of code. That language became Smalltalk, an object-oriented language inspired by LISP. Lampson’s machine with Kay’s software, coupled with a bitmap display and a mouse, was a prototype for machines 18 years ahead of its time.</p>

                    <p>The most unanticipated revelation of the era of computing is that consumers would find the most valuable component of a product or service to be the help. Like so many high school- and college-age folks in early days of microcomputing, Michael Krasny pursued the idea of becoming a programmer. He helped automate some of the accounting at his dad’s Toyota dealership on its Radio Shack TRS-80, which was a feat in itself. But having been told most of his life that he was a poor student, that’s what Krasny tended to believe.</p>
                    <p>In 1982, Krasny tried his hand at studying how to run a Burger King franchise. He didn’t get very far. Next he took a course in dBASE programming, which he aced, though it wasn’t enough to lift his spirits. Giving up his dream, he placed a classified ad and sold his PC for rent money. This would be the end of the story, except the fellow who bought it needed help setting it up. Discovering people would pay dearly for help, he realized you could sell PCs for cheap and make a decent living selling service. In <strong>1984</strong>, Krasny leveraged this plan to found Computer Discount Warehouse, CDW.</p>

                    <p>It looked like a copy machine. The device that brought Ray Kurzweil into the simultaneous businesses of pattern recognition, aural engineering, and artificial intelligence, was a scary thing for people living in the mid-1970s. In fact, the public’s reaction to seeing a copy machine-like box read text from an ordinary page that wasn’t printed with a special font, spurred Kurzweil to also become a futurist – someone who envisions the role of AI in society.</p>
                    <p>In 1974, a blind passenger seated next to Kurzweil on an airplane told him he didn’t consider himself handicapped, except for the fact that he was reliant upon another person to read him a newspaper or a book. That discussion launched Kurzweil on a two-year journey to apply the pattern recognition and voice synthesis techniques he’d already been refining, to the job of reading text aloud. The machine made its premiere in <strong>1976</strong>, in a live NBC-TV demo that almost didn’t happen, as it failed to boot two hours before airtime. When the demo did work, one very important viewer – composer and recording artist Stevie Wonder – became the Kurzweil Reading Machine’s customer #1. Their partnership has empowered the blind and also changed the face of sound.</p>

                    <p>On an early morning in 1997, Mike Lazaridis was being kept up by his baby son. Trying to accomplish two goals at once, he typed away at his keyboard while cradling his boy in the crook of his elbows. Slightly handicapped in his typing experience, he pondered the everyday handicaps faced by users of the “RIM 900 <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bcf5d2c8d9cefcdfc8d5cad9">[email&#160;protected]</a> Pager,” which his company had produced one year earlier. It looked like a small box you’d give a prospective fiancée, except underneath its lid was a tiny clamshell display, and inside were six rows of ball bearing-sized keys, in a QWERTY layout.</p>
                    <p>“When is a tiny keyboard more efficient than a large one?” Lazaridis wrote, in a document to be disseminated by his fellow employees at Research in Motion in Waterloo, Ontario. The epiphany had already occurred to him: “When you use your thumbs.” For the RIM 950 in <strong>1998</strong>, there would be only three rows of keys, tilted slightly on both sides, beneath a fixed display on a flat, black, one-piece console that sit neatly in the crook of one’s hands, like a tiny baby. The 950 got compared to many things, but the metaphor that stuck was a blackberry.</p>

                    <p>At the time E. Bronson Ingram promoted Chip Lacy to the post of CEO of Ingram Micro D in <strong>1989</strong>, Mr. Ingram was, by all accounts, the patriarch of a distribution empire. His intention was to pass his business on to his sons, but they were still in their 20s when it became evident to Bronson, perhaps before anyone else, that he would suffer from cancer. So at the time, he perceived Lacy as a kind of steward.</p>
                    <p>Some steward. Over an 11-year span of time, Lacy drove a period of astonishing growth. His strategy was to extend service, support, and education programs to smaller computer vendors, bringing even the boutique stores to competitive standing against larger chains. Small-town stores could sell IBM, HP, and Compaq equipment, and offer the same service and support as the manufacturers’ own licensed resellers. Following Bronson’s passing, Lacy evolved his division of Ingram Industries to the point where it was ready to go public. But a dispute with the family over Lacy’s continued role in the public company, now that Bronson’s sons were old enough to take the reins, led to Lacy’s dismissal in 1996. The distributor has become smaller and smaller ever since.</p>

                    <p>In 1978, a researcher named Jonathan Sachs left MIT to go to work for Data General, which at that time was among the few major computer manufacturers heavily invested in building microcomputers. Sachs was busy rewriting compilers to make them seem friendlier to users, when in 1980 he was asked to write a spreadsheet program. He’d never seen or heard of spreadsheets, so his boss loaned him an Apple II that ran VisiCalc. Borrowing more ideas from the manual than the program, Sachs wrote an application for DG that behaved much like VisiCalc, dubbed Supercomp. Like much business software of that time, it was leased to businesses for $950 for the first year.</p>
                    <p>Supercomp was the first major attempt at a spreadsheet outside of VisiCalc. DG had a supplier announce the product, which carefully described it as providing “computer-assisted forecasting, planning and analysis.” When VisiCorp’s Mitch Kapor met Sachs in 1981, Kapor was interested in exiting his contract, and the two started collaborating on a high-level language “graphical calculator.” In <strong>1983</strong>, this pairing became 1-2-3 for the IBM PC. Kapor’s innovation was adding automated plotting and graphics tools to Sachs’ spreadsheet. It became the PC’s first “killer app.”</p>

                    <p>The first PC networks, well before the phrase “local-area network” was coined, made the images of disk drives available to multiple units simultaneously. That’s all that disk servers did. When two copies of an application read and wrote records to the same database, it was up to the application to sort out which input/output operation was “legitimate” and which would be tossed out.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1981</strong>, Drew Major staked his claim as the principal architect of Novell’s first file server, to be called NetWare. His first rendition was a disk server for CP/M machines, and he immediately saw the drawbacks. He developed a “star topology” for a single computer that arbitrated networking requests from multiple clients. That computer would maintain its own, native operating system, its own database, and a network file system (NFS) that was independent from the clients. It was the first client/server model network orchestration of any kind — the innovation that finally convinced large enterprises to migrate their assets away from mainframes. Novell NetWare commanded the network OS market for the next decade-and-a-half — not even Microsoft could break through. Along with colleagues Kyle Powell and Dale Neibaur, Major led the effort to create NetWare.</p>

                    <p>When Mitch Kapor stepped down from the CEO’s post at Lotus in <strong>1986</strong>, Jim Manzi, its director of marketing, took his seat in April. A year earlier as Lotus’ President, Manzi had initiated a “diversification plan” that would move the company away from a spreadsheet application as its single tent pole. While it maintained its IBM PC product line, Lotus under Manzi sought alternative platforms, as the largest ISV supporter of the NeXT computer and one of the earliest to get behind Macintosh with unique applications such as Jazz — not just graphical knockoffs of PC versions.</p>
                    <p>Manzi’s plan built out Lotus as a broader business software company, enabling Manzi to implement an initially controversial “MVP Plan,” under which Lotus sold 1-2-3, Notes, and other titles in high volume directly to large, corporate accounts, bypassing major distributors like Ingram Micro D. Yet ironically, Microsoft’s failure to launch OS/2 as its own successor to MS-DOS hurt Manzi’s plans, which had included a spectacular graphical edition of the spreadsheet, 1-2-3/G. When competitors rushed their first Windows-based products to market, Manzi saw that Lotus wasn’t ready, and tasked his SVP, June Rokoff, with taking the necessary time to finish a solid competitor to Excel.</p>

                    <p>The first MAC in the field of computing, in many people’s hearts, was a concept brought to fruition by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in <strong>1963</strong>. It was a double-acronym, standing for Multiple Access Computer and Machine-Aided Cognition. And it represented the two simultaneous fields of study that MIT’s CompSci professors pursued: facilitating the first time-sharing systems, and conducting the first research on the integration of computing machines in people’s lives.</p>
                    <p>Project MAC received its seed funding from the U.S. Dept. of Defense, with the aim of exploring how time-sharing could enable multiple clients, or tenants, to perform everyday logical operations. The project’s first director was Prof. Robert Fano, who foresaw that just as electrical power stations delivered utilities to a nation, computer power stations (he occasionally used that phrase for it) could deliver <em>functions</em>. Fano saw a danger in continuing to instruct only computer specialists in the art of programming, rather than making programming approachable by everyone. By the turn of the decade, MAC’s “headquarters” was being referred to as the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, which would be the first to demonstrate such concepts as cryptography. Today, it operates as the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>

                    <p>In 1982, Nicholas Negroponte directed a department of MIT called the Architecture Machine Group. Ostensibly, it was about computer-aided design, and the role that computers could one day play in the creation and the construction of buildings and, by extension, modern art. But it had acquired a <em>de facto</em> second purpose: a show floor for MIT’s president, Jerome Wiesner, especially when walking his prospective sources of funding through the building.</p>
                    <p>As Negroponte tells the story, one of the demos he’s frequently give patrons showed a bitmapped display where typeset text shared space with photographs on the same, scrollable screen. That was astonishing enough for some people, until they’d click on a photo and discover it was video. Negroponte evolved this demo over time, integrating it with hypertext – still news to many people, including publishers and broadcasters, some 17 years after Doug Engelbart first presented it. Wiesner enabled Negroponte to build this demonstration into a full project, the MIT Media Lab, in <strong>1985</strong>. Within three years, the Lab had successfully coupled the hypertext demo with Internet-connected terminals. Many important figures in the formation of the Web were witness to the Lab’s first demos, including Steve Jobs, Vint Cerf, and Tim Berners-Lee.</p>

                    <p>By force of will, Jeff McKeever drove the MicroAge network of franchise stores in the United States and Canada through the deepest potholes and steepest recessions in the global economy. In 1998, during a massive financial crisis in Asia where the world’s PCs were being assembled, America’s computer retailers were faced with a “put-up-or-shut-up” moment. While ComputerLand stores chose to invest in colossal supercenters, McKeever led MicroAge to a controversial decision: It would spin off its distribution system into a separate company called Pinacor, while transitioning the MicroAge into a system integrators network that could, conceivably also be spun off.</p>
                    <p>It was not a smooth execution. As MicroAge made acquisitions to shore up its IT services strategy, major brands such as Compaq rescinded their distribution deals with Pinacor. MicroAge had built up a history of meeting sales incentives with producers, but now, producers rescinded their incentive offers as they were concerned dealers might not meet sales quotas. For the record, many did not. But McKeever’s decision prepared MicroAge in <strong>2000</strong> to become the company it needed to be for the 21st century: a provider of services first.

                    <p>One of the first Requests For Comment (RFC) in the Internet’s long history, numbered RFC 89, dated January 1971, was entitled, “Some Historic Moments in Networking.” Bob Metcalfe was joking. It was an overview of several “interim” protocols he had constructed for routing the output of a flight simulator through three largely incompatible DEC systems, at MIT’s Project MAC. Metcalfe made his work there the topic of his Harvard Ph.D. thesis, but in another historic moment in networking, Harvard rejected him.</p>
                    <p>In high demand nonetheless, Metcalfe chose to work for Xerox PARC. Xerox had just acquired Scientific Data Systems, one of DEC’s competitors. So Metcalfe and several of his colleagues, who had all become DEC PDP veterans, were not allowed to purchase a PDP for themselves. Their mutual decision was to build their own — an emulator that even included the bugs they knew were present in PDP. Metcalfe was permitted to revise his Harvard thesis, centering this time on “Packet Communication.” In <strong>1973</strong>, when PARC built a small version of their PDP emulator, called Alto, Metcalfe adapted his interim packet switching protocols and built a card for it. He dubbed that card “Ether Net,” though he’d remove the space later.</p>

                    <p>IBM and Microsoft thought they had a plan. Rather than contest each other’s rights to the operating system for the IBM PC, in 1987, they decided they would jointly produce its successor — OS/2 — and cross-license their creations to one another. IBM would produce an OS/2 for larger computers, while Microsoft would concentrate its efforts on OS/2 for machines with less than 1 MB of RAM. Windows would be Microsoft’s bridge to OS/2. And both could finally cast DOS into obsolescence.</p>
                    <p>But by 1989, it was clear neither company’s OS/2 could run DOS software reliably. The future of the operating system was sinking, and Microsoft needed a lifeboat. It had hired Dave Cutler from DEC, who was producing the kernel for Windows NT. Yet it was still over a year away. Windows needed an <em>ecosystem</em> – a public demonstration that world’s software and hardware producers were solidly behind it. So in <strong>1990</strong>, Microsoft Software VP Steve Ballmer put on a show, treating dealers and their customers to Windows 3.0 running on 386 PCs, with graphical previews of Lotus 1-2-3 and dBASE, and fully functional demos of PowerPoint, Excel, Ventura Publisher, and CorelDRAW. Customers were impressed, and Windows’ long-term future was secured.</p>

                    <p>History’s first great microcomputer was the Altair 8800, a kit that made the January 1975 cover of <em>Popular Electronics</em> magazine. History is usually unkind to anyone who places #2 on a list, but Bill Millard is an exception. In 1973, Millard founded IMS Associates as a consulting firm, helping automobile dealerships with minicomputers. When the magazine with the Altair hit the streets during the holiday season of 1974, Millard wanted to order several, but its manufacturer, MITS, wanted payment in advance.</p>
                    <p>Lessons in computer sales, number one: Never dismiss a customer who wants to buy in bulk. Millard and business partner Ed Farber decided to apply their own considerable skills to design a better, more reliable Altair. Then they set out to produce the first commercial microcomputers for resale: the IMSAI 8080. Prospective dealers wouldn’t have to pay 100% up-front; instead, they paid a flat dealer fee, with a commitment to sell 25 units per year. Following up on Altair, IMSAI placed an ad in <em>Popular Electronics</em> in <strong>1975</strong>, offering the model 8080 as a kit or fully assembled. When New York City’s first great computer store, Computer Mart, opened in February 1976, it quickly sold out of IMSAI 8080s.</p>

                    <p>In 1971, Frank Mogavero, Sr. started his family’s business in Woodland Hills, California, by buying out the contents of old offices, refurbishing the accounting machines — for instance, the Burroughs adding machines — and reselling them to small businesses. As the minicomputer industry took hold and manufacturers like Burroughs and DEC needed partners, Mogavero’s business had already attained an honorable reputation and a solid customer base. Throughout the late 1970s and ‘80s, Data Systems West became the most established channel partner in the state, putting it in prime position in the ‘90s to take on business from Sun Microsystems and a new, emerging networking company called Cisco.</p>
                    <p>Networking changed the game for manufacturers, which took advantage of the opportunity to sell PCs in bulk — and took advantage of the resellers channel while they were at it. The “W” in “DSW” had changed to stand for “Worldwide,” and Mogavero didn’t appreciate being treated like a little guy. So in <strong>1999</strong>, with the help of some networking partners and consultants, DSW experimented with an entirely new type of business: an application service provider for managed network services. Some seven years before Amazon Web Services, DSW’s B2n.com was a prototype of SaaS services to come.</p>

                    <p>In 1955, a Nobel laureate and former Bell Laboratories researcher named William Shockley had hired a handful of the world’s premier transistor engineers, to work at a research facility stuck in an old storefront next to a Sears. But Gordon Moore was not alone in feeling that Shockley’s paranoia had gone overboard. After a bizarre incident involving lie detector interrogations to determine whether someone had maliciously planted a metal pin in a door so the clerk would cut her hand, Moore and his colleagues staged what he later described as a mutiny.</p>
                    <p>The “Traitorous Eight” left Shockley’s company, on the advice of an MBA who introduced them to a venture capitalist named Arthur Rock. After having contacted several dozen NYSE-listed firms for prospective funding, and being turned down by all, in 1957, Rock introduced them to an aviation photographer named Sherman Fairchild. He had already established Fairchild Camera and Instrument, and invested just enough for the eight to start their own research firm: Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. In <strong>1959</strong>, Mr. Fairchild would acquire the firm personally. The team soon turned their attention from transistors to integrated circuits. Yet history would repeat itself nine years later, when Moore and associates founded Intel.</p>

                    <p>The dissolution of the PC hardware sales channel would begin with the establishment of the first successful “superstores.” Several organizations, including Tandy Corp., would try to build colossal, football field-sized retail warehouses whose entire inventory was on perpetual display to the public. By 1988, Soft Warehouse of Dallas had been in business four years, and its attempt at a “chain” had grown to just two. Big and cheap wasn’t enough to displace the entrenched channel just yet.</p>
                    <p>So Soft Warehouse was acquired by an investment group. They gambled that executives from the computer industry were not the right mix for establishing a successful retailer. In <strong>1989</strong>, they hired the man believed most likely to ascend to the CEO’s post of Home Depot: its SVP, Nathan Morton, who had earlier helped Target Stores to expand and conquer. Immediately, Morton applied the inventory formula that had become successful at Home Depot. Not even Morton’s family cared much for the name, so out the door it went, to be replaced by CompUSA. Its margins tumbled to just over 10 percent, and the stores’ success was balanced on a razor’s edge. But competitors couldn’t keep pace, and CompUSA succeeded will into the 2000s.</p>

                    <p>“Bankruptcy,” Xerox’s newly appointed Chief Operating Officer and board member, Anne Mulcahy, told her advisors in 2000, “is never a win.” Xerox had already relinquished much of the intellectual property it had created to other companies, most notably Apple. But at the turn of the century, it also appeared to be shedding something else: its <em>integrity</em>. The company was under scrutiny from the SEC for what appeared to be, at the very least, accounting “irregularities.” Mulcahy, already a Xerox veteran for decades, having worked her way up through research, could not be held personally responsible.</p>
                    <p>But it was her company now. So in a bold act of transparency, she took the lead and cooperated with investigators. In an act that put her neck in the proverbial noose, Xerox named Mulcahy CEO in <strong>2001</strong>. She volunteered testimony to the SEC, and publicly announced a restatement of over $2 billion in revenue. Then she turned her attention to wiping out Xerox’ $18 billion of debt. She spelled out her vision of the future, writing a fictitious newspaper article dated 2005, and told her staff, either you help this happen or you leave the company. Xerox exists today because of Anne Mulcahy.</p>

                    <p>Portable computers did not really mean portable workloads until 1984. Even when Kaypro and Osborne were at the peak of their popularity in the late 1970s, you didn’t see them running in offices eight hours a day. To make workloads truly portable, a portable PC needed to 1) be much smaller, 2) run much cooler, and 3) run MS-DOS on a real x86 processor.</p>
                    <p>The first machine that met this challenge was the Data General One, but just barely. It weighed over nine pounds, was back-heavy, and although it sported the first full-size, thin LCD display, it wasn’t backlit, and for some reason, glossy. It also cost nearly USD$3,000. Atsutoshi Nishida sensed an opening. In 1983, Toshiba placed Nishida in charge of a second effort to enter the US market, after the first failed drastically. His team already had a working model, but it was too much like the DG1. After he demanded it be made smaller, his superiors believed it wouldn’t sell. Fearing his efforts would be terminated, in <strong>1985</strong>, Nishida promised to sell at least 10,000 units in the first year, at $1,899. Nishida’s Toshiba T1100 became the first PC-compatible laptop to sell out.</p>

                    <p>In 1981, three Brigham Young University alumni – Drew Major, Dale Neibaur, and Kyle Powell – were hired by Novell Data Systems to produce a file server for the CP/M operating system. They had formed a semi-autonomous research unit called “the SuperSet” – which had its benefits and drawbacks. One benefit was that they could drift outside their project guidelines whenever they wanted. For instance, their CP/M project was allowed to become a network operating system called NetWare. One drawback is that executives didn’t always have an idea what they were up to.</p>
                    <p>When former GE Process Control Division engineer Ray Noorda first saw SuperSet’s work in 1982, it wasn’t even at Novell’s booth on the COMDEX show floor, but in a hotel room nearby. They were nearing bankruptcy, they had the key to the future of computing, and they weren’t showing it. Noorda responded by purchasing a one-third stake in Novell for little more than the value of a modern game show’s grand prize. He appointed the SuperSet as real managers, but directed them to alter their software to work on general purpose hardware, not just Novell’s hardware appliance. That move launched Novell Inc. as a provider of network operating systems.</p>

                    <p>In 1959, the US recognized the first person to have invented a device, or to have “reduced it to practice,” as the legitimate patent holder. For the three people who essentially innovated the components that led to the first integrated circuit, this was not to anyone’s benefit.</p>
                    <p>Two years earlier, Robert Noyce was the spiritual leader of the “Traitorous Eight” who, along with Gordon Moore, left the laboratory where the transistor was created, to form Fairchild Semiconductor. The exodus may have been necessary, given Shockley’s deteriorating state of mind. In July <strong>1959</strong>, Noyce clearly filed a patent application for a manner of fabricating semiconductors as layers. Moore credits Noyce (with whom he would later found Intel) with innovating the contacts between transistors, through the use of aluminum, as well as with detailing how his so-called planar technology could be mass produced. Texas Instruments researcher Jack Kilby was issued a patent for integrated circuit miniaturization in June 1964. However, Kilby filed his patent in February 1959. Though history (and the Nobel Prize) would find against Noyce, his suggestion that an entire IC should sell for less than the sum of its parts, would later become an inspiration for Intel.</p>

                    <p>When <em>Fortune</em> magazine declared in 1957 that computers will never become a profitable industry long-term, General Georges F. Doriot of American Research and Development invested in the business plan of Ken Olsen and partner Harlan Anderson, with the caveat that they not include “computer” in their company name.</p>
                    <p>Digital Equipment Corporation set to work on building “laboratory modules” and “logic modules.” They were the earliest attempt to break down computing power into things people could hold in their hands. By connecting these hand-held boxes using cables between their interfaces, everyday experimenters could build simple computers. “Programming” was a matter of arranging these modules in a pattern that produced a desired outcome — like devising the code of a microchip, over a decade before its invention. But with the revenue, Olsen led the development of a working model of a prototype, called TX-0, that he had worked with as a technician at Lincoln Labs a few years earlier. It was an interactive computer, with text on a screen and a keyboard. Again avoiding that word, DEC delivered the Programmable Data Processor-1 in <strong>1959</strong>.

                    <p>He had just been promoted to the post of “programming manager.” So Earl Pace’s employer — a financial services firm — sent him to a conference at the Mountain Shadows resort in Paradise Valley, Arizona. It was 1975, and there Earl sat with a room full of a few other similarly titled fellows. Not one of them was, like himself, African-American.</p>
                    <p>Being a black manager in a major industry was being treated like a condition. So Pace reacted by doing what men with conditions do, to move forward with their lives: He formed a support group. Together with a colleague, David Wimberly, Pace set up a conference room at the Sheraton in downtown Philadelphia. There were about a dozen-and-a-half folks in the room for that first meeting. They saw they were not alone, and they resolved to help each other and other men and women of color move ahead in an industry that was actively overlooking them. Working with headhunters, Pace began breaking down barriers for people of color to obtain jobs in IT. In <strong>1979</strong>, Black Data Processing Associates became a national non-profit organization with multiple regional chapters, recruiting thousands of active members nationwide to volunteer guidance, education, and professional support.</p>

                    <p>The Marchant company introduced the word “calculator” into the modern vocabulary. In 1958, Marchant was acquired by Smith-Corona, which was known for having produced quality typewriters for about eight decades. In 1963, an engineer named Tom Osborne designed what he described as a programmable calculator for the newly merged SCM. But it eventually rejected Osborne’s design, deciding that the calculator’s diodes needed to be one-fifth their current cost for the manufactured unit to break even.</p>
                    <p>After Osborne left SCM, he made a working, balsa wood model of his design, which failed to impress IBM. Perhaps last on his list, he visited David Packard and Bill Hewlett. After Hewlett accidentally broke the model, Packard had the idea that such a design could be cost-effective if it used integrated circuits, although discrete components would continue to be used in the prototype. As engineers on the project recall, Packard had consulted with Hewlett on the idea of producing Osborne’s machine as a “scientific calculator.” Using a one square foot, 9-layer printed circuit board, HP could build an inexpensive read-only memory (ROM) – a concept that IBM had only recently demonstrated. In <strong>1966</strong>, the HP 9100 would become the first programmable, IC-based desktop device.</p>

                    <p>“The last thing IBM needs,” said its CEO, Lou Gerstner, sometime during the 1990s, “is a vision.” When Sam Palmisano succeeded Gerstner in 2002, one of his first acts was to abolish the Corporate Executive Committee that Gerstner established in an effort to rescue IBM from a global economic downturn. Palmisano’s IBM would be defined by a vision.</p>
                    <p>That vision made its formal premiere in November <strong>2008</strong>, not at a computer conference or a company event but, unexpectedly, during a meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. Here, Palmisano introduced his notion of a “globally integrated enterprise,” not just for IBM but any corporation that conducts business worldwide. Rather than continue to conduct operations across divisions separated by continental boundaries, IBM would use distributed information resources to centralize assets, but deliver services to customers everywhere on the planet. Meanwhile, Palmisano outlined a vision of a corporation that devotes a significant share of its efforts to resolving global problems, such as more efficient delivery of power, water, and educational services. In a unique twist, he proposed that the undeniable global need for smarter systems will give all corporations incentive to compete to fulfill this need.</p>

                    <p>In 1980, VisiCalc was such an important application to the young field of microcomputers that Apple Computer had a VisiCalc department, even though it wasn’t an Apple product. Jeff Raikes was so good at building business models around VisiCalc spreadsheets that Apple hired him to continue building these models for Apple. Executives would give Raikes a puzzle to solve every day, and he’d solve it, for whatever reason.</p>
                    <p>“Whatever” turned out to be no good reason at all. After a single lunch with Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer, in 1981, Raikes left Apple to go to work in Seattle. Microsoft’s recent success with Tandy’s handheld TRS-80 Model 100 taught it that built-in programs were something users find of value. In 1982, with VisiCalc’s publisher offering more so-called “integrated” accompaniments to VisiCalc, and renaming itself VisiCorp, Microsoft needed a similar “integrated” strategy, quickly. Collaborating with former PARC programmer Charles Simonyi, in <strong>1984</strong> as Microsoft’s Director of Applications Marketing, Raikes conceived a vision for integrated programs that would accompany Simonyi’s Multiplan spreadsheet – programs that would run in partitioned windows, and that would process documents with multiple fonts and styles. For 24 years, Raikes’ vision would catapult him to President of the Office software division.</p>

                    <p>In 1976, Wayne Ratliff did not know all that much about football. He had a strong suspicion that he could construct a program that evaluated the statistics of each previous NFL game, and generate probability tables that would point to the likely winners of the next ones. It would be a feat of extraordinary artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Ratliff would need a computer. As an employee of Martin Marietta working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he had access to a big one. But it didn’t belong to him, so he opted for one of the IMSAI computers that Bill Millard had advertised in <em>Popular Electronics</em>. A natural language processor might have been a few years off, so first things first, he thought. He needed a big database – one that would serve as a loyal, logical second-in-command. Naturally, like any good sci-fi fan, he named it Vulcan. In <strong>1978</strong>, Ratliff devised Vulcan to manage the duties of data file manipulation – opening, closing, locking, etc. – for itself, leaving the user free to build a program around the database. Ratliff never sold his software – just the marketing rights, in 1980, to a company called Discount Software. It renamed itself Ashton-Tate, and renamed the product dBASE.</p>

                    <p>The perfect situation for a salesperson to find himself in, is the indispensable middleman between supplier and consumer. In 1974, Ed Raymund put himself in a very interesting situation. His day job was as a sales representative for major electronics manufacturers. His customers needed not just minicomputers and office machines, but the everyday supplies that go with them — rolls of paper, gear oil, black and red ink ribbons. So Ed formed a supply operation on the side, doing business as Tech Data.</p>
                    <p>By 1981, the side business had become a headache for Ed. He had hired a management team to run it for him, but they wanted to buy him out. Ed wanted to keep Tech Data in the family, so he sold it to his son Steve for the price of an automobile. The management team immediately left, taking their accounts with them. Rather than start all over and cultivate a new set, Steve took a gamble that Tech Data could make more money distributing office supplies in bulk than selling them to customers by the box. By <strong>1986</strong>, when he assumed the CEO role, Steve Raymund had built Tech Data into one of the nation’s largest computer distributors.</p>

                    <p>“The most powerful minicomputer project ever presented,” the January <strong>1975</strong> <em>Popular Electronics</em> article was entitled, “can be built for under $400.” The word “microcomputer” had yet to be coined. It was written by Ed Roberts and his business partner in MITS Inc., William Yates. Inside were the basic parts and schematics for the Altair 8800 — hobbyists could order the full plans from MITS. Six months earlier, Radio Electronics had published similar schematics for what it called a computer, but it ended up not being a complete kit.</p>
                    <p>Roberts proposed the idea for Altair to Art Salsberg, the magazine’s editorial director, saying he could base the design around Intel’s new 8080 CPU. Les Solomon, the technical editor, met Roberts personally in New Mexico. These two magazine editors, and these two hobbyists, formed a business plan: If they could sell at least 200 plans, they could purchase the Intel chips in bulk for a 75 percent discount. “Under $400” meant $397, and the first 8K RAM kits that shipped required steady hands on the soldering iron. For a $150 extra charge, MITS shipped 12K plus “Extended Basic,” the first consumer product made by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Altair started our world.</p>

                    <p>It was originally called “Ben Rosen’s Semiconductor Forum.” In the late 1970s, the place where anyone in the fledgling microcomputer industry made a name for itself was at a major conference. In <strong>1977</strong>, Rosen was a technology analyst who made his name known through television appearances. He saw that conferences brought the first vendors, manufacturers, and tinkerers together in one place, but they didn’t yet make conversation part of the program.</p>
                    <p>So Rosen created not only a showcase for products but a get-together for the people in the industry. In so doing, Rosen created the blueprint for modern tech conferences, with their high-traffic keynote speeches, and their “industry insider” sessions. As the conference grew, so did Rosen’s influence. Three years later, he left the analyst firm to start his own. He launched the Rosen Electronics Letter, one of the first premium newsletters to treat microcomputers as a legitimate industry. He also hired Esther Dyson as vice president of his firm, which she would take over as Rosen moved on to chair Compaq. Dyson nurtured PC Forum into the industry’s most fashionable annual event — the one place where controversial viewpoints and groundbreaking announcements were not only anticipated but mandated.</p>

In January 1982, Morton Rosenthal was the vice president of marketing and finance for a software company called Infocom, a creator of text adventure games that had just started publishing its own titles. It originally wanted to be a diversified software producer, but with its best-selling product entitled “Zork,” it wasn’t being treated seriously. Rosenthal presented Infocom with a choice of two strategies: produce different types of entertainment software, or strike out and compete against mainstream applications. It chose the latter, going up against dBASE with a product called Cornerstone — which was not a good decision.</p>
                    <p>So in <strong>1983</strong>, Rosenthal found himself on his own. Having tasted what it was like to sell a database product against the mighty Ashton-Tate, he concluded that businesses might find it convenient if they had a single point of contact for ordering multiple licenses — numbering into the dozens, perhaps hundreds. What’s more, they might even pay a premium for personal software support, which could include in-office demonstrations and even guaranteed upgrades. He founded Corporate Software, and the payoff was immediate. Bypassing Lotus’ arcane dealer policies, was what earned Rosenthal his nickname.</p>

                    <p>In 1918, D&amp;H Distributing was the brainchild of Dave Schwab and Harry Spector. During World War II, D&amp;H was one of RCA’s distributors for radio sets and appliances, starting with the Baltimore district. In 1944, RCA expanded D&amp;H’s territory to all of Maryland, literally on account of its existing distribution contacts having been killed in action. In the 1950s, Dave’s son Izzy joined the firm, whose business remained largely unchanged for three-and-a-half decades.</p>
                    <p>In 1986, as margins in the consumer appliance market shrank, RCA opted to exit the market. It sold its TV manufacturing arm and its brand to France-based Thomson, and the remainder to General Electric. Unaccustomed to the nature of business in the US, on 30 days’ notice, Thomson terminated its distributor relationships. In a do-or-die decision, Izzy and his children opted to distribute lower margin electronics at high volume. They chose the first 8-bit Atari computers (which sold around 2 million units worldwide during their history) and the Commodore 64 (believed to have sold at least 28 million units). Almost unwittingly, Izzy’s move made D&amp;H into one of America’s largest consumer electronics distributors. Today, D&amp;H is a healthy organization, as it prepares to enter its second century.</p>

                    <p>Taiwan began exporting computer products in earnest in 1979. Before long, the country’s producers had attained a reputation, earned or not, for manufacturing consumer goods, then business appliances, and later computers that were essentially cheaper “clones” of products produced by American or European companies.</p>
                    <p>Multitech Industrial Corp. made what North American buyers called “clones.” It produced 286 and 386 PCs in Taiwan and, in a process that lasted a good two months, shipped them overseas. It was a well-known firm in its home country. But in <strong>1987</strong>, when it had an opportunity to make a major sale to a German customer and lost, founder Stan Shih had had enough. In a push to reinvent not only his company but the image of Taiwan, Shih renamed his firm Acer. Next, he instituted an aggressive, organic corporate restructuring program, where dozens of regional business units worldwide were given greater, direct responsibility for the assembly and delivery of customer orders. Shih called this his “fast-food” plan. Restaurants produce high-quality food closer to their customers on assembly lines, he said, so Acer began producing computers the same way. Shih’s program not only remade Acer, but improved the self-image of his country.</p>

                    <p>The reason IBM created disk storage was not to store programs, but rather to serve as the first random-access memory. “Data” had yet to evolve beyond a list of organized values that had to be read sequentially – from the beginning. So starting in 1953, the company began constructing an array of rotating, magnetic disks. Al Shugart was assigned to head product engineering for RAMAC 305 – specifically, to make disk memory a key component.</p>
                    <p>But the disk array was not an independent component. With American Airlines already having been signed on as a customer for its Advanced Disk File technology, IBM had actually fallen a few years behind its goal of making disks adaptable and expandable. So the company reassigned Shugart to take over the ADF project. Immediately, Shugart dealt with bizarre problems, such as a shipment of contaminated oil that gummed up hydraulics supporting the head assemblies. He eliminated RAMAC’s battery of air compressors for suspending heads over the disks, replacing them with Jake Hagopian’s “flying head” design. By <strong>1961</strong>, IBM was producing its 1301 and 1302 disk storage units. Without realizing it at the time – but certainly realizing it later – Shugart was prototyping the future of disk drives.</p>

                    <p>It’s called a “stateful firewall” as a throwback to how firewall technology started: as a binary gateway designating whether traffic passes or gets dropped, based on a rule. As Gil Shwed re-envisioned it, there’s an argument to be made that the metaphor no longer applies. Nevertheless, the man who founded Check Point Software in 1993 dubbed the first <strong>1997</strong> product based on the technology he patented, Firewall-1.</p>
                    <p>The stateful part of Shwed’s concept refers to a kind of “memory” of the points in a network where rules may be applied. In the era of client/server architecture, servers were portrayed as castles or fortresses being bombarded from the outside. During Shwed’s four-year tour of the Israeli Defense Forces, he had more than a taste of the real world of distributed networks and electronic incursion. Even with four layers of intellectual property protection supporting Firewall-1, Shwed would spend a good part of the 2000s defending Check Point’s IP, as his fellow engineers left his company for Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks, among other firms. But distribution deals with manufacturers such as IBM and Sun Microsystems helped Check Point to establish the stateful firewall as standard equipment in modern data center networks.</p>

                    <p>Fearful that color in computer displays would lead to a demand for color printouts that it might not be able to meet, one day in 1974, Xerox executives decided everything it developed would be monochrome. It immediately terminated every researcher dedicated to color, including PARC’s artist-in-residence, Alvy Ray Smith. His contract had yet to have run one year, but he had seen enough of the Alto project, the mouse, and the first pixel painting program, that his mind was already made up.</p>

                    <p>In 1964, Xerox had announced a technology called long distance xerography (LDX). Since television signals could obviously be sent over long distance cable, Xerox used a CRT at the receiving end to scan the negative of an image onto the development drum of a copier. It was crude and a bit blurry, so that year Xerox partnered with Bausch &amp; Lomb, and hired a motion picture optics expert named Gary Starkweather, to see whether they could improve the resolution. In 1967, Starkweather came up with the idea of using a laser, whose amplitude could be controlled digitally. He quickly filed patents.</p>
                    <p>In 1970, researchers at Xerox PARC were working on bitmapped digital displays. With a laser, Starkweather quickly realized, an anamorphic system could be constructed with a $10 part rather than a $15,000 special lens. His boss assumed his plan to marry the computer with the copier was a clever ploy to undermine his authority so he’d get promoted. To shut him up, the boss offered Starkweather the promotion anyway, but he insisted on PARC instead. There in <strong>1971</strong>, Starkweather developed the first functioning laser printer, the concept for which would be popularized by Apple 13 years later.</p>

                    <p>At IBM’s San Jose research facility in <strong>1974</strong>, Don Chamberlin and his research colleagues were working on the first practical implementation of E. F. Codd’s Structured Query Language concept for relational databases. But part of System R’s objective was to justify the machines for which it was being built. For IBM, these were batch-processing mainframe languages, which set the course for how relational programs were executed.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile at UC Berkeley, an assistant professor named Michael Stonebraker sensed an opportunity. He’d been employed for three years, and was looking for tenure. Bell Labs was developing an operating system that could be adapted to multiple computers: UNIX. It had its own programming language, C, which was highly adaptable to mathematical operations. And a Berkeley colleague, Eugene Wong, was developing QUEL, an alternative declarative language. With a grant to produce a geographical database, Stonebraker produced Interactive Graphics and Retrieval System (INGRES). Against the advice of his superiors, he declared his work entirely public domain. A new contender against IBM in the database space — Oracle — would be first to work with INGRES. And soon after Ingres Corp. became a commercial entity, Stonebraker and his colleagues began work on the “sequel:” PostgreSQL.</p>

                    <p>When General Motors acquired Electronic Data Systems in 1984, it was partly with the objective of demonstrating how a corporation could realign its business strategies around data services, and then selling that concept to customers.

EDS had automated the existing structure, and was in the midst of fossilizing it. Dr. William Gruber and William R. Synnott had first published the idea of the Chief Information Officer in 1981. Now, GM was going to try it. He wouldn’t be the first CIO for a Fortune 100 company. His efforts would begin one of the largest corporate restructurings in the history of the world, reducing some 7,000 separate information systems down to a manageable 2,500 by 2003.</p>

                    <p>During the years when “Moore’s Law” was treated with the reverence of a law of physics, the basic, indivisible “atom” of computing power was the transistor. Gordon Moore’s formula was predicated on “cramming” (his word) more transistors onto silicon wafers. In the early 1960s, IBM was dealing with a transistor-to-bit ratio that was flip-flopped. It had just relocated its Thomas J. Watson Research Center from Columbia University to Yorktown Heights, New York. It had assigned Robert Dennard to tackle the problem of storing binary digits more efficiently.</p>
                    <p>It was <strong>1965</strong>. Several researchers were sharing their ideas for a kind of laminated memory board, where copper lines would intersect thin layers of magnetic film. Dennard was an observer, yet he was struck by how basic and uncomplicated the idea could be. It inspired him to rethink his own methodology, and he came up with a way for a single transistor and a single capacitor to maintain a binary state. Each capacitor would act as the gateway for the next transistor. Because the charge is continually refreshed, Dennard dubbed it “dynamic.” Dynamic RAM was conceived at Watson Center as a better idea in response to a good one.</p>

                    <p>It was the spring of <strong>1997</strong>. A group of UC Berkeley students and faculty, led by then-Assistant Professor of Computer Science Eric Brewer, undertook a challenge that might, or might not, bear fruit. It was the idea that the Web could serve as a transport not just for pages but for services. If everyday services were made basic, “atomic” (indivisible and, where necessary, reversible) and standardized, the UC Berkeley team concluded, there should be no reason why these services couldn’t be provided for any device, anywhere, regardless of size or location.</p>
                    <p>From the very beginning of their work, the UC Berkeley team was absolutely correct about two premier necessities of scalable architecture. One was that each client in the process should be capable of <em>scaling</em> the input and output channels to suit its own capabilities. Secondly, the servers in the process should by capable of <em>dynamically</em> determining the best way to fulfill each service request, at the time they receive it. That dynamic path came to be known as the “ninja path;” and thus, the team’s work was soon dubbed the Ninja Project.</p>

                    <p>During the 1990s, the meaning of “supercomputing” was changing. The National Science Foundation was funding the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1986. The emphasis there was on applications, not machines. It was becoming too expensive for NCSA to continue running its Cray supercomputers. Some at the University were actively considering whether supercomputers were necessary in order to build supercomputer applications.</p>
                    <p>While that deliberation was ongoing, in <strong>1993</strong>, two students named Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina spent a mere three months on an implementation of a client program for the emerging World-Wide Web. Their mission was to merge networked hypertext, which Tim Berners-Lee had already demonstrated, with multimedia. There were already Web browsers being actively distributed, so Andreessen and Bina did not need to reinvent the wheel. What they needed was an application that upheld the ideals that supercomputing used to uphold, but without the supercomputers. By leveraging the power of millions of Web servers, NCSA Mosaic – the first multimedia-enabled Web browser – hit upon the most upscale application there has ever been. For a year, Mosaic succeeded under NCSA’s stewardship. Its practitioners would leave to found Netscape in 1994.</p>

                    <p>When the Web first started taking hold as the method of choice for ordering equipment, parts, and services, it was expected to be a simple replacement for the printed catalog and the telephone line. What suppliers and distributors in the channel did not anticipate — for some, until it was too late — was that the Web would network their customers directly with their supply chains, completely rewriting the laws of supply and demand.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1998</strong>, Avnet — an electronics equipment supplier since 1955 — named Roy Vallee to its CEO post. Immediately upon taking command, Avnet transitioned to a logistics company, making several acquisitions in the process. It began offering a piece of software entitled, curiously enough, Rapid Benefits Estimation Tool (RaBET). Its purpose was to gauge the fluctuations in inventory levels, and effectively chart a visible course for customers for outsourcing their supply chain management, based on their own seasonal demand levels. RaBET introduced Avnet’s customers to principles of economics that were being hard-wired onto the global economy by the Web. Vallee’s retooling of Avnet charted, quite literally, the path for it to become IBM’s largest channel partner in North America.</p>

                    <p>At the turn of the century, electronics and computer superstores such as CompUSA were, willingly or not, choking the lifeblood of small resellers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Although Ingram was the largest distributor to these SMBs, it could not afford to keep losing too many of them to low-margin, high-volume competitors.</p>
                    <p>Ted Warner was one of the founders of Connecting Point of Greeley, Colorado. His was one of the first computer store brands to consolidate into a nationwide franchise during the 1980s. As the 2000s were approaching, there were fewer conferences to enable vendors to share expertise and ideas for adapting to a changing economy. So Warner helped to build an industry forum. Together with Myles Schacter, a reseller in Lawrence, Kansas; Steven Harper, the president of Network Management Group, Hutchinson, Kansas; and Jane Cage, the COO of Heartland Technology Solutions in Joplin, Missouri, he formed an industry forum with the unassuming name of Business Technology Centers.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1998</strong>, when Ingram was studying how to bring vendors together as partners in an industry forum, it found there already was one. It purchased BTC, renamed the group VentureTech Network, and assigned its SMB vice president, Rick Sbrocca, to lead it.</p>

                    <p>History will paint a portrait of Charles Wang, the founder of Computer Associates — which we know today as CA Technologies — with a variety of brushes and an unusual assortment of colors. The brighter shades of this portrait were first supplied in 1969 by — perhaps ironically now — the U.S. Dept. of Justice, when it filed its anti-monopoly suit against IBM.</p>
                    <p>It was a case with no end, and would be dropped in 1982. But in the meantime, during those critical years when IBM’s secret entry into the PC was being developed and rumors were being propagated, IBM made a public demonstration of unbundling its software from its smaller computers. In <strong>1976</strong>, Wang and his business partner, Russell Artzt, capitalized. With every cent of capital they could borrow, they established a service bureau in New York that would give Swiss software firm Computer Associates an entry into the US market. CA had a program based on little more than a sorting algorithm, called CA-Sort. Wang’s move gave CA the opportunity it needed to exploit the U.S. market, as a kind of organizational database for IBM’s own mainframe software. CA-Sort’s success launched Wang’s initiative to acquire the parent company in 1980.</p>

                    <p>It was 1974, and the U.S. Maritime Academy had commissioned the graphics research firm Evans &amp; Sutherland to produce a real-time simulation of New York Harbor, as seen from the bridge of a ship passing through. The job required a massive database of 3D geometry, and the engineers there decided it made little sense to use a database that was originally engineered for any other purpose than 3D geometry. So they created a written language parser that interpreted this geometry in a manner its engineers could readily understand. One of the associates in the room was John Warnock.</p>
                    <p>He took his lessons with him to Xerox PARC in 1978. When Warnock had the opportunity to build a graphics interpreter around PARC’s AI language LISP, he made a decision that was part-selfish and part-prescient: Using M&amp;A’s framework to produce a language for which he could get some credit, he produced a general-purpose printing instruction protocol called Interpress. Yet Xerox was always a hardware company first, so it declined to exploit Interpress further than for its own laser printers. Sensing Xerox’ short-sightedness, in <strong>1982</strong>, Warnock and Charles Geschke left PARC, taking Interpress with them to produce PostScript, the foundation of Adobe Systems.</p>

                    <p>Some day, engineers will make it possible for the world to work four days a week instead of five, Steve Wozniak’s dad told him when he was little. Washing machines, he said, freed people from the tedium of their lives, and in so doing, changed the world. So Wozniak declared himself an engineer.</p>
                    <p>If you reduce the list of things engineers could do to or for the Apple II to a manageable handful, Steve Jobs argued one day in <strong>1977</strong>, then the company would have greater opportunity to capitalize on expandability for itself. Woz, who was designing the Apple II at the time, did not disagree, though he didn’t like the implication. Possibilities, Woz argued, are what people see in a computer. The Apple I had been expandable, in the same sense that any open book could receive scribbles in the margins. Jobs wanted two expansion slots, and only two. But Woz had been conferring with some colleagues about a radically improved design for an expansion bus. He foresaw eight expansion slots on a bus controlled by only two chips. Woz built what he intended to build anyway. His stubbornness and his brilliance had combined to change the world.</p>

                    <p>A single photograph of the original Alto computer, without any accompanying text whatsoever, may give its viewer a clear impression that its producer had invented the personal computer. Alto had all the concepts we now consider critical to computing, in their primordial form: an interactive keyboard, a high-resolution display, a mouse that directed a pointer to graphics on the screen, integrated storage, and perhaps most importantly of all, the first Ethernet network.</p>
                    <p>The basic concept for Alto formed like the assembly of a solar system, in the mind of Robert W. Taylor. In 1970, Taylor began assembling the Computer Science Laboratory department of Xerox’ Palo Alto Research Center. Typically, when a research group forms, it’s the researchers who have all the brilliant ideas and the department head who needs to be convinced. This time, it was the reverse. During this time, PARC engineers Butler Lampson and Robert Metcalfe were among those contributing to the MAXC concept. During a 1972 retreat, Taylor tried convincing them to build MAXC with a bitmapped display, but as Lampson recalls, Taylor failed to convince them... at first. Over the following months, Taylor’s vision compelled them to build the first working Alto model in <strong>1973</strong>.</p>

                    <p>It was called the Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act of <strong>1991</strong>. Its principal sponsor was a senator from Delaware just beginning his fourth term, named Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Title II, Subtitle B, was very vaguely worded. “It is the sense of Congress,” it began, which on the surface sounded like Congress was rendering an opinion over drinks at a dinner party. Loose words could be loosely interpreted. And it gave lawmakers the impression that they could mandate computer security tools be equipped with back-doors for government investigators.</p>
                    <p>If privacy is outlawed, believed Phil Zimmermann, then only outlaws would have privacy. Zimmermann, who ran a small software producer, had a computer science degree, yet he loathed calculus. Angered by what he saw happening in the Senate, he found himself approached by Charles Merritt, an Arkansas cryptographer who had earlier developed an implementation of RSA’s public-key algorithm for Z80-based CP/M systems. If encryption were to have been intentionally crafted to be weaker, Zimmermann believed, then anyone or anything could exploit that weakness, not just governments. He used Merritt’s algorithms to help him overcome his own personal weak links in math, to build an encryption system he called Pretty Good Privacy.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 1970s, the major computer manufacturers did not regard the embryonic personal computer business as an emerging threat to their industry until the revenue chain started taking shape. Boutique stores were the first retailers to establish the brand presence of Apple, Commodore, Atari, and the brands that have since faded into history: Amstrad, Ohio Scientific, Exidy, and Apricot. Before many of these stores consolidated into chains, they began sharing names, perhaps unintentionally. There were “Computer Mart” stores across America and Canada before there was a Computer Mart chain.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>1976</strong>, one of those stores named Computer Mart in Royal Oak, Michigan was being run by Joseph Inatome, along with his son Rick as manager. They saw the advantage of name recognition, so they began acquiring and consolidating as many as 15 Computer Mart and Computer City stores, collectively under Rick’s leadership. Studying the success of his group’s advertising, Rick realized that consumers invested their trust in stores before they’d invest it in brands. He began a cooperative advertising scheme, which soon expanded into a big part of the burgeoning PC sales channel — a part that soon took on the name Inacom Corp.</p>

                    <p>The perfect situation for a salesperson to find himself in, is the indispensable middleman between supplier and consumer. In 1974, Ed Raymund put himself in a very interesting situation. His day job was as a sales representative for major electronics manufacturers. His customers needed not just minicomputers and office machines, but the everyday supplies that go with them — rolls of paper, gear oil, black and red ink ribbons. So Ed formed a supply operation on the side, doing business as Tech Data.</p>
                    <p>By 1981, the side business had become a headache for Ed. He had hired a management team to run it for him, but they wanted to buy him out. Ed wanted to keep Tech Data in the family, so he sold it to his son Steve for the price of an automobile. The management team immediately left, taking their accounts with them. Rather than start all over and cultivate a new set, Steve took a gamble that Tech Data could make more money distributing office supplies in bulk than selling them to customers by the box. By <strong>1986</strong>, when he assumed the CEO role, Steve Raymund had built Tech Data into one of the nation’s largest computer distributors.</p>
