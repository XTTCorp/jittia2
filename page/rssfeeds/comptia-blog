Her desire to help others led her to her first job as an emergency medical technician (EMT)—but after many years in such a high-stakes, 24/7 field, she decided it was time to make a change. Entering the tech industry was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marbury Akinjo found she was able to transfer many of the skills she learned as an EMT, such as making smart decisions under pressure and teamwork, into a new career in IT project management. She completed the &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/project"&gt;CompTIA Project+&lt;/a&gt; certification to expand her knowledge base and catch the eye of prospective employers, and it worked—she’s now an &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-it-project-manager"&gt;IT project manager&lt;/a&gt; for Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/career-change/switching-career-path/from-jobs/healthcare-to-it"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vital Signs: How to Change Careers From Health Care to IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From the Ambulance to the Office&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of my EMT career, I loved everything that I did. I loved getting calls. I loved helping people,” Marbury Akinjo said. “After several years I didn't enjoy it anymore. I felt like I wasn't being my best self. I didn't enjoy getting the runs. I didn't enjoy helping people as much as I did.” And when she injured herself on the job, she knew it was time to move on from emergency medical services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech was booming, and Marbury Akinjo wanted to be a part of it. “I thought it was cool,” she said. She also liked that technology was such a broad field. “There are so many different opportunities in tech that I can always make a lateral move—or I can stay where I'm at. I’ll never get bored. I just love that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding Her Place in the Tech World&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she had made up her mind, she determined what kind of role in tech she could excel at. “I went into IT management because I knew that I wanted to manage people,” she explained. “I didn't meet the deep technical knowledge that maybe a developer might need. But I was still able to be part of technology without being the person who created the software.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because she was entering IT from an entirely different profession, she looked for mentors that she could learn from in the field. “Having mentors has helped me a lot, as well as just shadowing people doing the job that I wanted to do,” she said. When building a relationship with a mentor, listening is key. “What I found is that people love to talk about themselves and what they do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my role as an IT project manager, I like to say that I herd cats,” she said, laughing. “My job is to gather resources, ensure that our stakeholders understand what we're going to be delivering and make sure that we deliver what we promised within our financial constraints.” She adds that technical skills such as understanding IT infrastructure and how it interacts with different kinds of software is essential to the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having experienced a layoff in the past, Marbury Akinjo is also focused on what she calls “future proofing” her career. “To me, future proofing is making myself the most valuable employee, taking steps to increase my skill set, increasing my knowledge and increasing my value to another employer,” she explained. “I want to make sure that I am in control of when I leave a company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of her reason for getting CompTIA Project+-certified. She wanted to increase her earnings and be competitive in future job searches. “Employers value CompTIA,” she said. “It is very well respected in the technical space. I believe having that certification has helped me to stand out from the other project managers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits of an IT Career&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to her past work as an EMT, Marbury Akinjo is happier to be in a career where stress levels are more manageable. “I know that if I don't answer an email at seven o'clock at night that someone won't die,” she said. That said, her EMT experience has helped her manage stressful situations for herself and her team at work. “I feel like I bring calm to chaos,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in IT has benefitted Marbury Akinjo outside the office as well. “My career has afforded me the opportunity to be financially stable,” she explained. “I can take my kids on amazing international trips. I can take a couple of weeks off from work and enjoy time with my family. And that's something that I would not have been able to do as an EMT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marbury Akinjo’s advice to others looking to reinvent their careers in tech is straightforward. “First, figure out what you like to do, then narrow down and focus on an area that interests you,” she said. “Then find someone actually doing the work and shadow them, and then start taking the certifications, the low hanging fruit that will increase your worth right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, she is planning to take more certifications herself. “My next career goal is to become a program manager. I really want to focus on cloud delivery, so &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cloud-essentials"&gt;CompTIA Cloud Essentials+&lt;/a&gt; is what I'll be working on next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn the skills you need with CompTIA CertMaster Learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-learn/trial-sign-up"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.

As tech companies look to augment their current and future processes and products, they should proceed with caution and evaluate potential risks associated with the technology and how it is being used in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as cybersecurity threats go, the current versions present increased risks to be aware of, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced phishing content&lt;/strong&gt; that sounds like something a native English speaker would say (as opposed to another language poorly translated into English)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling less experienced bad actors to use malicious code that they may not otherwise have the expertise to write or find on their own&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential to hack or hijack an AI chatbot tool&lt;/strong&gt; in order to direct people to malicious sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown or missing parameters&lt;/strong&gt; to determine how conversational AI tools can be used in a licensed form&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related Blog: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/how-to-think-about-chatgpt-and-the-new-wave-of-ai"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Think About ChatGPT and the New Wave of AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter Defenses, Transparency Will Be Critical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that human error still accounts for most successful cyberattacks, enhanced phishing practices shouldn’t be taken lightly. We’ll need smarter defenses on the inbound side to detect and quarantine these more sophisticated messages. End users already struggle to identify phishing attempts, and now they could appear even more legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If malicious code becomes easier to obtain, it will lead to an increased volume of issues. Drawing in even 1% more wannabe criminals to execute hacks and phishing attempts at the same rate increases organizations’ and end users’ risk. The potential to redirect people from legitimate chatbot sites/tools to malicious sites is where things get particularly interesting. In the early stages, as the industry sorts out the guardrails, it will take time for the AI to recognize the difference between good and bad actors. The algorithms might err on the side of inclusion, which could lead to some bad stuff being ingested and recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As popular search engines explore and integrate conversational capabilities into their results, what are those recommendations going to be based on? In a keyword-driven SEO world, it’s pretty clear. Relevant meta-tagging, cross-linking and search rankings provide a pretty decisive score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’re not sure how that’s going to pan out in a ChatGPT-like world. Transparency around how this is going to work is very important for people to trust the process. When answers are presented without context, people are more likely to trust them because they come across as definitive. You ask a question and get an answer, but you don’t question whether it’s the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to parameters and licensing, most of today’s solutions run on the same servers from the same code base. What happens when they start to get calls to run in independent environments? What will the service-level agreements (SLAs) look like governing their use? How do they keep the functionality from being acquired by the wrong sort of actors? There are so many unknowns, it’s hard to know where to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Follow the Innovation, Ask the Right Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m still in a wait-and-see mindset as it relates to ChatGPT and cybersecurity. We’ve heard grumblings that OpenAI is working on a new version that is 15 times more powerful than what has been released to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t surprised to hear that, but it raises some questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can it process more algorithms more quickly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are the responses 15 times more relevant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that possibility hard to believe. These processes eat &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-26/microsoft-openai-investment-will-help-keep-chatgpt-online"&gt;&lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; amounts&lt;/a&gt; of&amp;nbsp;data. Several years ago, a CompTIA board member noted that the industry hadn’t begun to capitalize on the sale of pure processing power in the cloud. He was very prescient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cloud apps today eat hard disk space but have very meager CPU intensity in the same sense as something like ChatGPT. Now just think of hundreds of these engines running simultaneously, consuming trillions of CPU cycles every minute!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Whose IP is it Anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s a non-cyber factor to follow. How will the developers abide by copyrights and trademarks? Search engines don’t pretend that the content they serve up is their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way ChatGPT is displaying, at least for now, it looks like the AI is magically producing all the answers and crafting the content itself. Of course, the truth is that it has ingested and summarized the internet (at least through the end of 2021) to produce an answer to the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it knows about writing a sonnet, it has learned from what real people have done. I can see a system of micropayments to content creators and website owners every time their works are accessed or used in a meaningful way. If developers don’t solve for this infringement issue early, they could be hit with lawsuit after lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons (and more), it’s a space to follow very closely. At the very least, IT companies should familiarize themselves with the technology, because customers are going to be asking questions, and you’re going to want to have some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get more tech insights like this right in your inbox with CompTIA’s IT Career Newsletter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://certs.comptia.org/it-career-news-blog-subscription/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and you can save 10% off your next CompTIA purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todd Thibodeaux is CEO of CompTIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:67b2c364-a934-6311-a3b7-ff0a008d0b43</guid><title>Voucher Discounts: How To Save Money on Your IT Certifications (2023 Refresh)</title><description>Getting an IT certification is an investment in your career.

&lt;h3&gt;1. Save with a Bundle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchasing a &lt;a href="https://store.comptia.org/"&gt;bundle&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way for anyone to get a voucher discount. CompTIA combines exam vouchers with training materials into bundles to help you fully prepare for your certification exam and save up to 46%* off the retail price. Many bundles include the exam voucher, training materials and a retake voucher in case you don’t pass your exam on the first try. With a bundle, you can go into your exam with confidence knowing that you’ve set yourself up for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CompTIA offers three types of bundles, and most of them include the following products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="basictablenotresonsive" style="width:100%; display: table;"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;     
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CompTIA Bundle Type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Included in the Bundle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;tr&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="right" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Basic Bundle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="right" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Official CompTIA Study Guide eBook, an exam voucher and an exam retake voucher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="right" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Exam Prep Bundle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="right" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Official CompTIA Study Guide, CompTIA CertMaster Practice, an exam voucher and an exam retake voucher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="right" style="text-align: left;"&gt;eLearning Bundle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="right" style="text-align: left;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-learn/trial-sign-up" title="" class="" target=""&gt;CompTIA CertMaster Learn + Labs&lt;/a&gt;, an exam voucher and an exam retake voucher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This struggle has become the norm, not the exception, as IT skills gaps continue to widen. The good news is when organizations use the right tools, such as &lt;a href="https://solutions.comptia.org/view/738979175/"&gt;apprenticeships for tech&lt;/a&gt;, IT hiring becomes much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tech apprenticeship program is a structured talent development program that allows companies to hire for in-demand, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/comptia-a-plus-jobs"&gt;entry-level tech roles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and develop those employees for promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These underutilized programs typically last one year and require employees to participate in industry-aligned IT training. With the right program, employers gain the ability to solve their IT and cybersecurity hiring problems for good and transform their entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;Tech Apprenticeships Help Employers Solve the IT Hiring Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers who are willing to offer apprenticeships can use this pathway to source highly driven talent from outside their organization, while also creating a viable pipeline for lateral and upward mobility among existing employees. In today's tight talent marketplace, employers who opt to adopt apprenticeship have a significant edge over their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But tech apprenticeship programs offer &lt;a href="https://solutions.comptia.org/view/738979175/18/"&gt;benefits beyond filling IT labor market gaps&lt;/a&gt;. Apprenticeships help employers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a highly skilled workforce and promote a company culture of ongoing learning and competency in tech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create ROI – for every dollar invested in an apprenticeship program, organizations recoup $1.47&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expand and diversify the talent pipeline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve employee retention and productivity – a remarkable 92% of apprentices continue working for the same company post-apprenticeship&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Positively impact communities – every $1 invested into apprenticeship programs results in a public return of $28 in benefits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://solutions.comptia.org/view/914994265/"&gt;CompTIA&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apprenticeships for Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides the tools and support employers need to get started with an apprenticeship program. In addition, &lt;a href="https://air-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUvfuGprjojH9DD7j0zuhRmDTzC0aItnqIA"&gt;CompTIA Decision Labs&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by American Institutes for Research (AIR), can help organizations decide if hiring from a multi-employer existing program or creating their own program is the best choice for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tech Apprenticeships Benefit IT Pros, Educators and Training Providers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that apprenticeships help connect people to promising careers in tech. With a tech apprenticeship, IT professionals can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Earn a competitive wage while they develop high-demand skills that are aligned to what employers need&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get valuable hands-on work experience that improves their career stability and competitiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enter a career that may previously have seemed unreachable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT pros involved in &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/lp/apprenticeships-for-tech"&gt;CompTIA Apprenticeships for Tech&lt;/a&gt; can also earn industry-recognized &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications"&gt;CompTIA certifications&lt;/a&gt;. These credentials will add weight to their resume and broaden their IT skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educators and training providers can also derive value from tech apprenticeships. &lt;a&gt;These programs enhance career pathways for aspiring IT pros, increase career development and employment opportunities, and launch initiatives that make a positive impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;Through tech apprenticeships, workforce development, educators and training providers can support the shift to competency-driven skills acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Get Your Tech Apprenticeship Program Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is more than one way to offer tech apprenticeships. Some organizations choose to launch these programs independently, while others opt to work with an intermediary. The latter can be a wise move for busy companies, as an intermediary can administer the program, oversee the apprentices and design learning plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/lp/apprenticeships-for-tech"&gt;CompTIA Apprenticeships for Tech&lt;/a&gt; is a solid option for businesses that want to offer IT apprenticeships, but don’t want to do it alone.

Yet around the world, hiring managers, HR professionals and industry leaders are noticing that while IT professionals possess valuable technical skills, they sometimes lack foundational knowledge. This poses a problem in a world where technology is woven into the fabric of every organization and employers are already facing many challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in further, let’s take a minute to level set. Foundational knowledge is the what and why — the understanding of how networks function, how technology enables a business to run, how different areas of technology work together, and why things like data analytics and cybersecurity are crucial to business operations. Technical skills are the how – the expertise required to perform tasks and use programs and tools in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers and workforce development professionals play an important role in working toward a solution to this issue. That’s because it’s vital that we upskill existing workers. For all of the talk about millions of openings, the real issue is that today’s hiring managers need IT professionals that have comprehensive foundational technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not as simple as finding great IT pros – you need to build them and continue to provide them with opportunities for growth. Fostering an environment within your organization where open dialogue about strengths and weaknesses is the norm will help set tech professionals up for success from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s tight labor market, training, upskilling and reskilling hold the keys to creating a more digitally fluent workforce that will propel the industry forward. Supporting your employees and offering them opportunities to learn and fill knowledge gaps is a key factor in creating a vibrant workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Missing Fundamental Knowledge is a Global Issue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I have spent time with CIOs, CISOs, and hiring managers from around the world. For example, in September 2022, I was invited by &lt;a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/2376388/ncsa-appoints-new-cyber-chief-amid-security-push"&gt;Amorn Chomchoey&lt;/a&gt;, Chancellor of the Thailand National Cybersecurity Agency (NCSA), to teach his security operations center (SOC) team about visualizing security alerts and events using a tool called &lt;a href="https://blog.securityonion.net"&gt;Security Onion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;img width="500px" title="James" alt="James" src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/jamesbd658c563ca94a219ac1ab1fefcaee55.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working with NCSA’s Chancellor, Amorn Chomchoey during a security bootcamp for about 100 of his employees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Chomchoey’s employees are deeply talented. They know how to use tools like Security Onion, and we had fun teaching each other new things. They were stronger than many other professionals I’ve met around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;But even though many of them have advanced cybersecurity knowledge, almost all were missing foundational knowledge, such as how applications and networks talk, specifically in reference to network protocols. Many of these workers also needed information about how the Domain Name System (DNS) works in more detail, from recursive lookups to NXDOMAIN requests. After all, it’s difficult to discover various types of DNS-based attacks if your workers don’t know the essentials of DNS in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This problem is not unique to Chomchoey’s team. Industry leaders from around the world find that their employees don’t always have adequate technical foundations. I’ve heard about this for years from hiring managers about their otherwise talented IT and security employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;For example, Mike Geraghty, chief information officer for the State of New Jersey, said that he and his team spend a significant amount of time teaching first-year security employees the foundational elements of operating systems and networks. They will often say, “You can’t protect a network if you don’t know how it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I have also noticed that professionals with more advanced skills don’t always understand some of the more basic, essential networking protocols. I’ve met penetration testers who lack a fundamental understanding of the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), arguably the most often-used and often-hacked protocol that exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This fundamental knowledge is critical and helps to build more well-rounded tech professionals. It behooves any hiring manager to have an open dialogue about an employee’s skills at the beginning of the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Why the Disconnect?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I’ve found that the in-demand, well-rounded IT and security professional needs to know the foundations. This includes knowledge of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Typical networking handshakes, including the TCP 3-way handshake, the TLS/SSL handshake and HTTP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Storage concepts, both in terms of hard disks and cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;How to read log files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;However, hiring managers often note that professionals are weak in these areas. There are several reasons why this happens. First, security professionals are increasingly expected to specialize in areas of IT and security. As people specialize, they tend to skip things to bring focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Second, sometimes IT professionals don’t want to highlight foundational skills, especially when trying to make a good impression during the interview process, because they fear that talking about such basic things might lead employers to think they don’t know or possess the more advanced, in-demand skills. Without these conversations, hiring managers don’t know what foundational skills candidates possess – or lack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Third, organizations don’t always do a great job onboarding their employees. For example, the onboarding process may not allow for new employees to demonstrate their knowledge level. Sometimes, what we think is a healthy dialog between employee and employer isn’t all that helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;As you can see, there are several reasons for the disconnect, but ultimately it boils down to a lack of digital fluency among employees of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Building Digitally Fluent, Well-Rounded IT Professionals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Digital fluency is the measurement of a person’s – or even an organization’s – ability to use a particular technology effectively to accomplish a project or a goal. Digital fluency doesn’t mean that you know how to use a device as a consumer, but rather that you have in-depth knowledge of how – and why – that particular device works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;When it comes to IT and security professionals, it’s important for them to have the right foundations. Strong foundations create more top-tier, well-rounded, efficient IT professionals. A great time to look at whether or not your employees have a good understanding of these things is during the onboarding process, or even before. If you understand where their strengths and weaknesses lie when they join your organization, you can offer them training that will allow them to brush up on their weaker skills and help them – and your organization – thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Opening a dialogue where employees feel heard and cared for from the get-go will help them to feel more comfortable coming to you or their manager when they encounter something that they don’t understand or need more training on – even if it’s just a refresh on the foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;What Can HR and Workforce Development Pros Do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Digitally fluent employees help strengthen and unlock the potential of your organization. Ensuring your employees have foundational knowledge is key. Foundational knowledge gives professionals the ability to keep their feet the next time there’s a big shift in how we use the technology that helps propel us forward. Having that foundation also allows organizations to focus on developing “T-shaped workers,” someone with deep knowledge in one area, but adequate knowledge in many areas. It will also make it possible for your security workers to better troubleshoot and identify root causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;One solution is to create a better screening process to help make sure that potential workers have the foundations that they need. Hiring managers can help on this front by creating job postings and questions that focus on foundational skills. Instead of creating job postings that ask for too many advanced skills, focus on the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;But we all know it is far, far easier on your time and budget to develop internal talent than to go out and find it. It’s important to develop digitally fluent employees that can bring abstract concepts to life and tie learning to real-world examples. In other words, if they learn about the TCP handshake, the next step would be to find an example in your organization’s systems and infrastructure and dig into how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Take a close look at your organization and review what professional development, training and upskilling opportunities are offered to your employees. If you don’t have any yet, start with CompTIA.

One of the bikers I rode with gave me the name Fishtail. And it just so happened that it is also a classic Cherokee name,” Fishtail said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nearly three decades in working in the tech sector and two decades at the same company, the senior web programmer with the unusual name recently came to a career crossroads. He decided it was time to refresh his skills and get new certifications to stand out in today’s competitive job market. Upon completing &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a"&gt;CompTIA A+ certification&lt;/a&gt;, Fishtail was able to update his resume and land an excellent new position in his field. Here’s how he did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decades of Experience in the Tech Industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishtail has been fascinated by technology since he was a child. “My first computer was a Commodore 64 … I’m really dating myself here,” he said laughing. But, in reality he has been working in tech for 27 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember when I got my first tech job,” he said. “It was in Icon Author, which probably doesn’t exist anymore. And I thought, ooh, I get to do this, really? It was exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That excitement fueled a career that kept him in the technology industry for a few decades – and he was content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Life Change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major life change led Fishtail to look into CompTIA certifications. “I had been with my previous company for 20 years,” he said. “During that time, they were acquired by another company and announced bankruptcy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was laid off without severance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding a job and working on my CompTIA certification became high priorities.” So after decades working in the field, Fishtail went back to school to finish his college degree. He completed CompTIA A+ certification as part of his graduation requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishtail didn’t know much about CompTIA at the time, but he was impressed with the rigor of the curriculum. “At first, I thought, yeah, it's just a ‘read the book and you’ll pass’ kind of certification. Then I started studying and took the exams. I said, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is legit.” With dedication and focus he was able to complete the course and earn CompTIA A+ certification in 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I took the CompTIA exams online,” he explained. “The proctored exam has you take photos of your workspace. They have a video conference with you through your webcam—they can see what's happening on your computer, so you don't cheat.” He noted it was very similar to some eLearning he had done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying straight from a book can be a challenge for Fishtail, who is dyslexic. Fortunately, his CompTIA course had extra tools that helped him learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a hard time reading through [all the materials],” he said. “The practice questions and the practice scenarios really helped me learn the most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Value of CompTIA A+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he started looking for a job, Fishtail realized just how valuable his new CompTIA A+ certification was. In fact, it was a major factor in helping him land his current gig: A contract web programmer position with Dominion Energy in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CompTIA certification helped me get the role because it's one of the additional things, other than work experience, that they were looking for,” he said. And, in fact, his CompTIA A+ certification is already helping him on the job. “I've learned a lot about how the help desk works. It also helped me see lot of areas where I could help my company,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Significance of a Work-life Balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Fishtail could study for his CompTIA certification at his own pace—as well as having a tech career that allows him to telecommute—are huge benefits for his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have three children who are all high functioning on the autism spectrum,” he said. His wife homeschools them, and because he works from home he can occasionally help if a child needs extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishtail says his children have taught him a lot about how to interact with co-workers. “I’ve learned to have a lot of patience,” he said. “I’ve also learned that some people think differently, and you’ve got to understand where someone is coming from [to successfully work with them].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior web programmer, Fishtail has a wealth of experience to share with people interested in a similar career path. “The questions I would ask somebody looking into this field are: Do you like to solve hard problems? Are you willing to fail? And are you willing to do boring stuff, like tracking bugs in code, to get to the exciting stuff? If you are, then programming is right for you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he’s not riding with his local motorcycle club, singing with the Barbershop Harmony Society or serving on his city’s arts council, Fishtail is committed to furthering his tech knowledge through CompTIA. He says a security certification might be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like to continue with my degree in cybersecurity and information assurance, and then try to look for a position where I can be one of those secure programming people for an organization,” he said. “I think CompTIA certifications will give me a leg up in the job market because they're legit. They actually prove real-world knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe just as important as knowledge, skills and experience is confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CompTIA certification has given me more confidence than ever in my tech career,” he added. “It helped me unlock my potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn the skills you need with CompTIA CertMaster Learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-learn/trial-sign-up"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.

It encompasses all of the elements and components required to bring a technology product to market, including suppliers, distributors, customers, government regulations and other stakeholders. The technology ecosystem is constantly evolving and changing as new technologies emerge and disrupt existing markets."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not bad, given that many of us, even with decades of experience in the tech industry, struggle with a clear definition of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My perspective, though arguably less cerebral than that provided above, is perhaps best illustrated by a race car driver. As business owners, chief revenue officers, or sales or marketing leaders, we are always thinking about our ideal customer profile (ICP). Not a bad thing … but we are doing ourselves, and our companies, an injustice if we stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look through that ICP lens for a moment, and "open the aperture" to see what influences exist around the customer profile. When the driver is speeding around the track, there is not much else to see. But that changes dramatically when the driver pulls into the pitstop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the driver (your customer) is swarmed by a dozen or so crew members, all with a specific task toward one common goal—to get that driver back out on the track in a matter of seconds. When we view the ICP from a broader perspective, we see each of these crew members is working in a carefully orchestrated dance to support the driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with a technology ecosystem?&amp;nbsp;Everything. Those crew members represent the various entities influencing your customer.&amp;nbsp;Asking these simple questions of your customer helps bring into focus the ecosystem that surrounds them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What (else) do they buy? (Assuming they are already buying from you or your competitor)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they buy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When do they buy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do they buy?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who influences their buying decision?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you understand who else is influencing your customer, you have a more complete view of how they get their job done and how you fit into the larger picture. By understanding all of the influencers impacting your customer, you can increase your value to that customer, as well as unlock various other routes to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by other routes to market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s step away from the race car analogy and focus on a real-life example. One of my clients is an independent software vendor that developed a Salesforce add-on that provides a unique solution to the age-old question: How can a sales team get more out of their pipeline – aka, close more deals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we looked at our ICP (in this case, sales managers), we quickly realized that there are various other influencers impacting our customer. These influencers took the shape of Salesforce consultants (comprised of more than 170,000 certified professionals), sales methodology experts and coaches, and other complementary sales software solutions.&amp;nbsp;Each of these represents a new route to market via referral partnerships or strategic alliances, and a viable way to form strong relationships with other entities that are also targeting our ICP. Make sense?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to ChatGPT, defining a technology ecosystem as "an interconnected network of organizations, individuals and technologies," we can see that you, whether you are a SaaS leader, distribution partner or managed services provider, are but one component impacting your customer. Doesn’t it make sense to have a clear view of who else is impacting your customer? Especially given the fact that the "technology ecosystem is constantly evolving and changing as new technologies emerge and disrupt existing markets", ChatGPT warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greg Plum is a director at ecosystem advisory firm PartnerReady and a member of CompTIA’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/connect/communities/north-america-community"&gt;&lt;em&gt;North American Community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; executive council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="callout blue"&gt;

Of course you’ve heard about ChatGPT. Every media site on the planet has written multiple stories about ChatGPT at this point. Most of them have used ChatGPT to help write some of those stories (full disclosure: ChatGPT was not used in the writing of this article). After some opening acts featuring artificial intelligence (AI) image generators like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, the text-based ChatGPT took the world by storm at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though everyone knows what ChatGPT is by now, here’s a quick summary to help set the stage for some further analysis. ChatGPT is a product from OpenAI, which also delivered DALL-E 2. These tools, along with many others that have been released or are currently being developed, use new programming models based on the “transformer” algorithm released by Google in 2017. This algorithm delivered a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here/"&gt;huge breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; in deciphering text, which led to the general class of AI models known as large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building a LLM and training it on huge datasets available from the internet, companies are delivering products that define a revolutionary new wave of AI. Getting a computer to write has gotten even more attention than getting a computer to draw since there are far more applications for written communication. The whole thing has reignited the debate around robots taking over our jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Asking the Right Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a business perspective, the question on the mind of most decision makers is: “Where can we use this?” Some applications seem obvious; anywhere text is being generated is a tantalizing candidate for tools like ChatGPT. Then there are other applications that might not currently be centered on text but could be re-engineered to use the underlying algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better question, though, might be: “How will we use this?” Artificial intelligence isn’t the type of technology that can be purchased as a standalone product and plugged into a data center. Along with powerful capabilities, AI has unique characteristics that will impact any implementation. As IT pros evaluate opportunities for their organizations, they should understand these characteristics and provide context to the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3 Characteristics of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like most emerging technologies, AI is an &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/content/whitepapers/the-role-of-emerging-technology-in-digital-transformation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enabling technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of providing value on its own, it provides value as a component of other applications. As an example, think of something most people have seen already: Email. Most email applications today have an auto-complete feature, where an AI algorithm predicts and suggests the next words or phrases as someone is typing. An organization wouldn’t focus on the specifics of the AI in this case—it would focus on the overall functionality of the email program and the additional value that AI might provide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most significant difference between AI and previous software is that AI produces outputs based on probability.&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional software is deterministic. That means that a set of inputs will always produce the same output. AI is probabilistic. An algorithm receives inputs, then calculates an output based on combining those inputs with the data used for training. It’s basically giving a guess, and that guess can provide unexpected insight, but it can also be &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Voices/2023/02/03/ChatGPT-finding-facts-mistakes/8201675428484/"&gt;incorrect&lt;/a&gt;. Plans for using AI must include plans for overseeing the output to make sure mistakes are caught and corrected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is vulnerable to one of the sneakiest truths about technology: The best tech doesn’t always win.&lt;/strong&gt; There can be many reasons for this, but as technology gets more widespread in business and society, one of the main reasons is the difficulty in changing behavior. Think back to the email example. When the program gives a guess about what comes next, the user has to consider the suggestion, decide if it’s appropriate and hit the tab key or something similar to accept the suggestion. That’s a lot different than just continuing to write. Is there enough improvement in the end product to justify the learning curve? The answer to that might not be clear in a product demo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Need for AI Skills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three characteristics all factor into the big debate mentioned earlier: Will AI eliminate a wide range of existing job roles? Even though AI capabilities will continue to grow, it seems far more likely that AI will &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; a wide range of existing job roles. AI-based programs have the potential to heavily automate tasks or produce unique insights, but they might never get past the point of needing some degree of oversight (think of how self-driving cars seem to have hit a limit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when we talk about “AI skills,” we’re not just talking about the ability to code an algorithm, &amp;nbsp;build a statistical model or mine huge datasets. We’re talking about working alongside AI wherever it might be embedded in technology, whether that’s help desk ticketing systems, network routers or cybersecurity monitors. There will be growing demand for new AI specialists, but there will be much greater demand for AI expertise across the many tech roles that currently exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay up to date with CompTIA and tech skills by subscribing to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://certs.comptia.org/it-career-news-blog-subscription/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CompTIA’s IT Career News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.

The &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/which-certification"&gt;CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway&lt;/a&gt; can be a great resource to determine where you’re at. If you want to protect organizations from cyberattacks and threats, and follow the right path, then cybersecurity manager could be your next move.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What Is a Cybersecurity Manager?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cybersecurity manager is in charge of the overall cyber safety of an organization. This is an advanced-level job role that includes managing a staff of cybersecurity professionals. Here are a few ways a cybersecurity manager supports an organization:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leads all facets of day-to-day cybersecurity operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provides subject matter expertise in designing and implementing security safeguards to cloud, on-premises, endpoint, edge and mobile infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manages cybersecurity budget and creates metrics to track performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintains security protocols and policies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manages teams and projects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/8-cybersecurity-jobs-that-require-project-management-skills"&gt;project management&lt;/a&gt;, the cybersecurity manager determines the overall goals and plans of a cybersecurity department, along with being quick-minded when comes to discovering problems and resolving them efficiently. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How To Become a Cybersecurity Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organizations are typically looking for someone with around 0-2 years' experience in a job role such as a &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-security-analyst"&gt;cybersecurity analyst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-penetration-tester"&gt;penetration tester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-network-administrator"&gt;network administrator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/it-careers-path-roadmap/it-support-specialist"&gt;IT support specialist&lt;/a&gt; or a related job role. Some job postings seek candidates with 0-5 years of experience. Applicable industry-recognized certifications and training such as &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/comptia-advanced-security-practitioner"&gt;CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+&lt;/a&gt;), CISM or CISSP are great ways to stand out. As for education, a high school diploma, vocational training or a bachelor’s degree in a related field is what we usually see in cybersecurity manager job descriptions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity managers should possess some important professional skills, including the ability to: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anticipate problems, communicate them and resolve appropriately&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work independently and as part of a team&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage multiple concurrent objectives or activities, and effectively make judgment calls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take ownership of issues and responsibility for customer satisfaction and the overall success of services provided&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to credentials and important professional skills, a cybersecurity manager should have knowledge and experience in:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/project-management-and-cybersecurity"&gt;Project management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/all-about-linux-and-linux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/nist-cybersecurity-framework"&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-information-technology-risk-management"&gt;Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Presenting a good mix of professional and technical skills are often seen as beneficial when job hunting, as it can help a future cybersecurity manager assess how the organization operates and how to approach protecting the organization from cyberattacks and threats. Certifications like &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security"&gt;CompTIA Security+&lt;/a&gt; can help you get started.

CompTIA members will get that chance again March 14-15 at CompTIA’s &lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/events/view/comptia-communities-councils-forum-(ccf)-2023?sfredirect=/ccf"&gt;Communities &amp;amp; Councils Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-on-one sessions between industry experts and MSPs looking for help &lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/blog/six-genius-sales-tips-for-people-in-the-business-of-technology"&gt;have proved successful&lt;/a&gt; (and helpful), and this time CompTIA has recruited geniuses for topics including cybersecurity, marketing, sales, workforce/hiring and leadership/strategy to answer questions and give advice in 25-minute sessions at CCF. The sessions book up quickly, so interested corporate members are advised to schedule a session sooner than later because space is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come for the Advice, Stay for the Member Networking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1:1 sessions provide valuable insights and actionable advice that can start to be implemented into businesses almost immediately, said previous Genius Café attendees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We offer cybersecurity, but we felt we could improve. When I spoke to one of the geniuses, I got a better way to start looking at what we were doing and we were able to fill in gaps and strengthen our security offerings,” said Sarah Goffman, CEO of TCE Communications, a Rockford, Ill.-based MSP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, TCE Communications now offers dark web scans, a service it had not provided previously, and enhanced customer education and training initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dark web monitoring was something we used internally before—we did scans to see what info was out there about us, but it was not on our radar to offer to all our clients until the Genius Café conversation,” Goffman said. “Plus, the training initiatives have absolutely helped our customer relationships. Our customers know we have their best interested in mind and we want to bring them an entire security package, not just equipment. So dark web monitoring and more training helps us bring in more of a security culture to companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone scheduling a Genius Café session, Goffman advised to come prepared with several prioritized questions in order to maximize time. “It’s a great way to have a 1:1 conversation with someone who is an expert in that field. They understand the space, they answer questions and they’re a great business resource. It’s really beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brendan Turner, president and CEO of Turner Techtronics, lauded his experience with a marketing genius at an earlier event for helping him strategize how to target into new industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My organization struggles with breaking into and marketing to new market verticals such as healthcare and finance. [The genius I talked to] was very knowledgeable and provided great insight and vertical specific ideas for our website and marketing program which I will share and implement with our sales team,” Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jhovanny Rodriguez, vice president and co-founder of GreenLink Networks, Addison, Tex., and founder of Synetek Solutions, has ample experience as an MSP and selling to MSPs. As a prior sales genius at a CompTIA event, he helped MSPs avoid simple mistakes that could improve their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the common mistakes he often sees are MSPs “winging it,” i.e., selling without any formalized strategy or process. “Whether you’re generating sales through lead generation or referrals or word of mouth, there needs to be a defined system of what to do—and not to do—when you get a lead,” Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip: take a personal approach on follow-ups with customers. “I see a lot of MSPs who have a great customer meeting, then go back to the office and email a proposal and never hear back,” Rodriguez said. “A customer many interpret an email pitch differently than you intended. Email proposals focus more on the number, not on the value you are providing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn from Experienced Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSPs of all sizes—even the most successful ones—can gain new insights and find a nugget to take back to their business, said Raffi Jamgotchian, CEO of Triada Networks, who has served as a cybersecurity genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re all at different places in our journeys. There’s always someone who is one or two steps behind you. Being in security for 30 years, there might be something I can impart based on what I’ve done or what has been successful or not successful,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, MSPs might want to review their cybersecurity solutions stack and identify where potential gaps or improvements may lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some MSPs have stacks but aren’t sure about them while others don’t know where to start,” Jamgotchian said. “What I tried to impart is identify what problem you’re trying to solve and look for the products and processes that work best for you and ultimately help you solve the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genius Café sessions at CCF will focus on cybersecurity, sales, marketing, cybersecurity, and leadership. Overall, the idea is to provide non-bias, valuable content that connects directly to people looking to improve their businesses, said Jason Kemsley, technical director of Uptime Solutions, West Sussex, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no better way to make sure you are growing as both a business and as a person, than to collaborate 1-to-1 and receive some knowledgeable takeaways direct from an expert,” said Kemsley, who has served as a leadership genius in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversations are not one-sided. The geniuses said the sessions are valuable to them also, providing an opportunity to refine their own messaging and learn from others too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They say you learn better when you’re teaching it. It helps you articulate the value of things more succinctly and to consolidate some things I’ve learned into some bite-sized things that folks can take away,” Jamgotchian said. “I felt like I was learning as much as the person sitting across from me. It was definitely a two-way street. It’s a great way to get people a safe space to ask questions. One of the things CompTIA does very well is providing that safe space. We’re all here to help each other out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the CompTIA Communities &amp;amp; Council Forum, the Genius Café will be March 14-15 for 1:1 sessions. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information and availability, contact GeniusCafe@comptia.org.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Ready to Talk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="Managed Services Community" title="" class="" target=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Register now for CompTIA’s &lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/events/view/comptia-communities-councils-forum-(ccf)-2022?utm_source=CCF&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CCF-Genius-Cafe" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Communities &amp;amp; Councils Forum&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:2d773b0d-2497-4561-859e-bc17c0b09dc0</guid><title>CompTIA Certifications: The Antidote to Imposter Syndrome</title><description>Earning CompTIA Security+ helped cybersecurity specialist Vina Ta squash imposter syndrome, deepen her knowledge of IT security and reinforce her passion for working with people.</description><link>https://www.comptia.org/blog/comptia-certifications-the-antidote-to-imposter-syndrome</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><a10:content type="text">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/comptia-certifications-the-antidote-to-imposter-syndrome.png?sfvrsn=8230efa7_2" data-displaymode="Original" alt="CompTIA Certifications The Antidote to Imposter Syndrome" title="CompTIA Certifications The Antidote to Imposter Syndrome"&gt;Cybersecurity professionals are in high demand. There are more than &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/the-top-9-jobs-in-cybersecurity"&gt;700,000 job openings&lt;/a&gt; for cybersecurity positions in the United States alone. When an IT pro earns the necessary experience, skills and certifications to specialize in cybersecurity, it benefits the entire IT industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vina-ta/"&gt;Vina Ta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-cybersecurity-specialist"&gt;cybersecurity specialist&lt;/a&gt;, Lordstown Motors Corporation, is one of the cybersecurity pros working hard to keep sensitive data and systems safe. But how did she get where she is, and what role did CompTIA play in her success? Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Fast Track to Cybersecurity Success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Vina Ta, the journey to a role in cybersecurity has been deliberate, focused and relatively brief. She first earned her bachelor’s degree in computer science from Kent State University in 2019. While she was a student, in 2018, she landed a 7-month internship at Diebold Nixdorf as a security education analyst. Ta then transitioned to another 7-month cybersecurity internship role at Park Place Technologies in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Ta accepted a position as a &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-security-operations-center-(soc)-analyst"&gt;security operations center (SOC) analyst&lt;/a&gt; for Binary Defense, where she worked for nearly two years. In July 2021, she stepped into her current role as cybersecurity specialist for Lordstown Motors Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Perks of Working in Cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is a fantastic field to work in, not just because cybersecurity pros are in demand, but also because it often leads to a better quality of life. A few of the things Ta loves about her job as a cybersecurity specialist include having a great manager, great co-workers, a great team and an exceptional work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People think when you work in cybersecurity that you're working around the clock,” Ta said. “But a normal day for me is getting coffee, checking in on my co-workers, seeing what my tasks are for the day and then getting into that unique day’s rhythm. So, there is no monotony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ta also loves that cybersecurity requires lifelong learning. Learning makes her happy, and with her job, she gets to do a lot of it. She also loves that she gets to make people feel comfortable in understanding and learning about cybersecurity and cited compassion as her biggest strength. You may not automatically associate compassion with cybersecurity, but as evident in Ta’s role, there can be a strong link between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you can understand how people are, it makes it so fun when you're training them or educating them or talking to them,” she said. “You are able to give them that personal touch that's often missing in tech, in my opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Power of People in Cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many employers seek cybersecurity specialists who not only have experience and skills, but relevant IT certifications. &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security"&gt;CompTIA Security+&lt;/a&gt; is an example of an in-demand cybersecurity certification. Ta earned CompTIA Security+ in April 2021 to further her knowledge and skills. But why did she choose CompTIA Security+, and how did it benefit her? To begin with, it deepened her knowledge of cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CompTIA Security+ gave me a baseline understanding of the different departments and roles within cybersecurity,” Ta said. “I value the certification because it doesn’t just focus on one specific criteria. You learn about many aspects of cybersecurity, such as identity access and security operations. I took the certification exam after I’d already been hired, when I had time to focus and study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy peer competition also played into Ta’s choice to earn CompTIA Security+. As she watched a few of her co-workers earn CompTIA Security+ and &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network"&gt;CompTIA Network+&lt;/a&gt;, she experienced a greater desire to earn CompTIA Security+ herself. Ta also values CompTIA Security+ because as she studied for the certification exam, she found her ultimate passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the process of studying for the exam, I found my true passion, which is in the people side of cybersecurity, such as security education and business. I love working with people and realized that as I prepared for my exam,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ta wasn’t the only one who was thrilled she became CompTIA certified. Her boss was also happy. Her employer values CompTIA Security+ because it gave Ta a holistic overview of cybersecurity and allows her to focus on key areas that are relevant to her job role.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="callout blue"&gt;
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Is CompTIA Security+ Worth It? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/is-security-plus-worth-it"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide For Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Antidote to Imposter Syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imposter syndrome is a thief of confidence, and most people deal with it at some point in their career. Ta attributes her lack of imposter syndrome and success in her job in part to CompTIA Security+, which boosted her confidence in ways she wasn’t expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imposter syndrome is when you feel like you're inadequate in your field or department,” Ta said. “Earning CompTIA Security+ made me more successful in my field by helping me prove to myself that I could do anything I set my mind to. By getting CompTIA Security+ and landing a job, I realized I am more than what I thought I was originally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short period of time, Vina Ta has experienced considerable success in her cybersecurity career. With the recent addition of CompTIA Security+ to her resume, paired with her dedication to learning and people, the sky's the limit for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn the skills you need with CompTIA CertMaster Learn. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-learn/trial-sign-up" title="" class="" target=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for a free trial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt; today!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:9e97b0f7-1729-4500-b675-835e2b51ef59</guid><title>'CompTIA Helped Me Grow My Business and Avoid Mistakes'</title><description>Chris Ward felt like he was repeating the same mistakes.

Learn 3 ways this principle helps secure your environment.</description><link>https://www.comptia.org/blog/get-started-with-the-principle-of-least-privilege</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 15:43:31 GMT</pubDate><a10:content type="text">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/3-examples-of-the-principle-of-least-privilege.png?sfvrsn=e66aabcc_2" data-displaymode="Original" alt="3 examples of the principle of least privilege" title="3 examples of the principle of least privilege"&gt;The principle of least privilege is a basic cybersecurity tenet. The idea is to provide as little access to a resource as possible while still allowing a successful transaction. Such a transaction might be accessing a file, managing a service, administering a system like Active Directory, running applications, connecting to a specific network, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principle of least privilege falls under the umbrella of a &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/what-is-zero-trust-and-why-does-it-work"&gt;zero-trust security policy&lt;/a&gt;, which operates on the idea that even internal resources are untrusted and must be authenticated and authorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic applications of the principle is the oft-heard advice not to log on to a system with a root or administrator account. These accounts almost always have more power than is necessary for a user doing daily tasks like checking email, web browsing, running a spreadsheet program, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robust implementation of the principle benefits the organization by reducing the chances of security breaches, malware or mistakes. The effects of user mistakes can be catastrophic, such as the recent grounding of planes in the United States caused by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/faa-outage-that-delayed-thousands-of-flights-caused-by-contractor-who-deleted-files.html"&gt;an unintentionally deleted set of files&lt;/a&gt;. However, users used to a more open environment will likely have difficulty adapting to being restricted to only the resources applicable to their role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn three ways you can use the principle of least privilege, including a basic permissions scenario, managing group memberships and concluding with a more complex application management example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example 1: File and Folder Access&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with a straightforward example. Suppose a file named vacation-policy.txt exists on a Linux server. Likely, all users should be able to view the policy file contents and discover how much vacation time they can take. However, allowing all users to edit the policy would be absurd!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To translate this example into Linux terms, all users should have the read (r--) permission to the file, but only a few users should have read and write (rw-).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An Advanced Example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll extend the example to something a little more complex. Imagine a webserver and the various roles associated with it. The &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-server-administrator"&gt;server administrator&lt;/a&gt; should have access to system and application configuration files, but probably not website content files. &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/it-careers-path-roadmap/software-and-web-developers"&gt;Web developers&lt;/a&gt; should edit (read and write) the content files but not access server or application configuration files. Finally, website users should only be able to read specific content files and certainly not upload or change any files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the principle of least privilege means granting the most restrictive permissions possible that still allow users the required level of access for their role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example 2: Managing Group Memberships&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a larger context, consider administrators working in a Windows Active Directory environment. The standard superuser account is the Domain Administrator. Any member of the Domain Admins group has virtually unlimited privileges within the domain. These privileges include the administration of services like DNS and DHCP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what if you delegate DNS and DHCP administration to specific IT staff members? These folks need complete administrative control of the two services but should not have any authority over other Active Directory objects, such as user or computer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft answered this need by providing DNS and DHCP administrative groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS admins:&lt;/strong&gt; Administrative access to configure the DNS service&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DHCP admins:&lt;/strong&gt; Administrative access to configure the DHCP service&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these two groups, a senior administrator could delegate DNS and DHCP administration to junior administrators without granting complete domain administration privileges. This is a great application of the principle of least privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AD also includes the DHCP Users group, which permits read-only access to the DHCP information—perfect for auditors or contractors. Microsoft also recommends administrators create other service-specific administrative groups, as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other delegation and default group examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/sudoers:&lt;/strong&gt; Delegate Linux administrative privileges carefully by writing a precise sudoers configuration file for the sudo command&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administrative groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Control membership in administrative groups, such as the Linux wheel group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous and default accounts:&lt;/strong&gt; Remove Windows and Linux anonymous or other default accounts, if possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/etc/sshd_config:&lt;/strong&gt; Configure the Linux SSH service configuration file to deny root access (administrators should elevate their privileges via sudo after the connection rather than connecting as root) and restrict which SSH clients are allowed to connect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example 3: Control Applications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to files and service configurations is not the only issue. The principle of least privilege also applies to applications. Modern organizations maintain a list of authorized programs users and administrators may run. Users typically only have access to the applications associated with their job roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, IT personnel such as &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-technical-support-specialist"&gt;support specialists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-help-desk-technician"&gt;help desk technicians&lt;/a&gt; often use configuration scripts and troubleshooting applications that standard users should not be able to access. One way to manage such tools is a read-only shared folder that contains authorized versions of programs and trusted copies of scripts. Only the required IT staff members should have read access to this share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Active Directory environments can enforce the use of authorized software by implementing Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies. These Group Policy settings identify applications and apply rules defining whether the application is allowed to run on the system. WDAC enables administrators to enforce the organization's authorized programs list. This is one method for mitigating malware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons to control applications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Malware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuration scripts not fully understood by non-IT personnel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limited apps based on need, license costs, support, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mitigate Mistakes With the Principle of Least Privilege&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principle of least privilege is one of the most critical components of a zero-trust security posture. While I provided three examples of the principle, there are far too many examples of applying the principle to be included in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of some basic guidance and practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img width="600px" title="9 Guidelines for Applying the Principle of Least Privilege" alt="9 Guidelines for Applying the Principle of Least Privilege" src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/9-guidelines-for-applying-the-principle-of-least-privilege.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the principle of least privilege, identities are granted access to resources only at the level required and no higher; if the user only needs to read the file, they are given the read permission and not read-write. This approach helps mitigate malware, mistakes and data breaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn the skills you need with CompTIA CertMaster Learn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-learn/trial-sign-up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

Now, let’s explore three real-life use cases where virtual reality (VR) training is already happening today. There are some common threads across these educational use cases, but there’s also a great deal of the “art of the possible” happening here that can only be defined by the users who decide to participate in the metaverse itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is AR/VR?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/content/research/understanding-emerging-technology-virtual-reality-augmented-reality"&gt;Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)&lt;/a&gt; are often mentioned in the same breath. While they are similar technologies, they have different use cases and require a different style of input from a user.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AR is when a 3D object (minimum 1 object) is affixed into a physical space that the user is in. An example of this would be receiving directional arrows on the windshield of your car from the GPS that has directions programmed into it. Another popular example is the mobile game Pokémon GO, which places Pokémon creatures in designated or randomly generated places where the user points their external camera on a smart device to see and battle them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;VR takes place within a fully immersive 3D environment and requires the user to have a headset on to view the environment, typically alongside a controller that allows the user to manipulate the environment. An example of this would be the popular VR game Beat Saber. But what are some more practical use cases for VR in a professional setting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use Case #1: Safety-driven Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common example where VR training is being used today is where scenario-based hands-on training results in an unsafe environment. Think of a firefighter: In order to train a firefighter, you have to expose them to fire or smoke. You also have to have a building you can simulate this in that is semi-controlled. This also means that you can only train for firefighting that takes place in a building when many fires occur out in other spaces and environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a VR firefighter training that simulated an overturned hazardous chemical truck on the highway. I had to evaluate the truck to determine what chemicals were inside of it, then run back to the firetruck and decide which type of solvent I would use to put out the fire – water doesn’t put out an oil fire, for instance. After selecting the proper solvent, I ran back to the vehicle on fire, opened my hose, and felt the force feedback on my controller as I doused the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen iterations of this training that add a mask to the headset to simulate low oxygen intake which forces the trainee to respond in more lifelike conditions. These exercises are also typically conducted in a simulation room with full firefighter gear on to create accurate physical response. But that doesn’t prevent the firefighter from taking this training over and over and over again because they are not actually exposing themselves to any real hazards. This creates better outcomes at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police departments are doing the same, using VR to educate their officer corps on how to properly handle active shooter scenarios. EMTs use VR to educate themselves on simple emergency care, like inserting IVs, suturing wounds and dealing with unruly and violent patients in need of triage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical field has made significant investments in VR training with entire VR simulation rooms in some modern hospital systems. Most surgical errors take place within 90 days of the surgeon first performing a procedure, so the need for practice, repetition and refinement is critical. Practicing on cadavers is expensive and only limited to the four walls of the facility itself. Surgeons can now take headsets home and continue their practice with haptic gloves and 3D printed precision instruments. This leads to better health outcomes and a reduction in expensive litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use Case #2: Augmented Reality to See a Hidden World&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most discussed applications for AR are heads-up-display (HUD) related. Think seeing Google Maps-type information on your eyeglasses as you walk down a street, someone’s LinkedIn profile popping up when you meet them at a conference or a tutorial as you assemble an engine block, an IKEA couch, or an incoherently designed children’s toy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken interesting AR trainings for utility companies that show where lines are buried underground and teach technicians how to do their jobs safely and troubleshoot problems in the field effectively. I’ve seen AR trainings for pilots showing flight paths around metro areas as they descend and go into holding patterns while awaiting ground clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology already exists in some luxury cars as they feed you information on the windshield HUD related to speed limits and navigational directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the hardware itself catches up to the myriad of applications being designed today, you’ll see a massive amount of opt in for augmented reality. It’s important to understand that this will never quite be perfect enough for some users though, so there’s no real reason to wait until it is. In other words, for every user that wants a sleek pair of stylish glasses, there’s another who wants a contact lens and another who wants a skin patch underneath their eye that projects the information upwards in eyeline. There’s no doubt in my mind that people will opt into cybernetic optics as well as this technology demonstrates a greater application over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use Case #3: Virtual Soft Skills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use cases around VR for safety and AR for information recall are so logical that they have the feeling of being nascently inevitable. Outside of these defined use cases there is a growing interest in using mixed reality or extended reality (XR) as a communication environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XR can be defined as an umbrella term that encapsulates VR/AR, including the capability to dive in and out of both with ease (mixed reality). This means you can be sitting in your office with a headset looking at 3D data visualizations on your monitor and with the push of an input you will enter a 3D environment where you can review that data with your peers who are also equipped with the right hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many users who spent the pandemic on back-to-back video conferences, there was a strong feeling that the tiled windows were not immersing us and teaching us the same way as a live environment would have. If you couple that yearning with the future demographics of the workforce who spend hours after school on Discord video chatting and gaming with friends, then you will see that organizations that invest in XR communication and collaboration initiatives will have a competitive edge in their speed of communication, not to mention their recruiting advantage in the open market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large firms like Accenture are already onboarding their new hires in their proprietary XR environment called "Nth Floor." Some of these collaboration spaces are digital twins of physical offices, while some of them are more designed for user interactivity and digital events. As workforces continue to be distributed across larger geographies, organizations that fit this profile will look to create greater collaboration and a replacement for time and resource intensive travel commitments with XR solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next Stop: The Metaverse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AR/VR/XR and the metaverse have left their port and are well on their journey, there is still much discovery to be made. Organizations may forget the business challenges of the pandemic too quickly and go back to business as usual, or an economic downturn could force IT solutions and IT spend to take an iterative rather than innovative approach. Artificial Intelligence will also play a large part in XR as AI tools will help render environments, objects and scripts in ways that are hard to predict market impact. AI will shape education before many other industries, and this will undoubtedly influence the shape of the metaverse to come. The metaverse is not a new idea, but the people engaging with it are bringing new ideas and use cases every day.&lt;/p&gt;

Companies that produced hardware, created software or were in the business of fixing said hardware or software, were tech companies. As technology has become woven into the fabric of all organizations, those lines have blurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that educational programs are accessible to provide students with the competencies needed to fill open IT roles in order to prepare them for success and make them employable in today’s digital economy. With many organizations going through digital transformations, by including a best-in-class IT curriculum at your school, you create employment opportunities for your students in every sector, wherever they choose to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tech as the Driver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CompTIA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cyberstates.org/"&gt;State of the Tech Workforce&lt;/a&gt;, more than 500,000 tech occupation jobs have been added since 2016, a result of the demand for tech talent across all industries. Digital transformation drives this demand in manufacturing, retail, healthcare, automotive and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we don’t begin to offer and encourage IT curriculums as a standard at all academic institutions across the globe, there simply won’t be enough talent to fill all of the open tech job roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal here is simple—to help provide students with sustainable IT career pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CompTIA Resources Help You Build a Curriculum&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resources you gain access to when you become a &lt;a&gt;CompTIA Academic Partner&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;can help you deploy turnkey curriculum including fundamental digital skills, IT and cybersecurity. These give you the ability to leverage CompTIA eLearning courseware and hands-on labs to prepare your students for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our full suite of CompTIA learning solutions helps instructors maximize classroom time and deliver engaging content, helping learners achieve mastery and improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along with myriad resources that come with the Academic Partner Program – career pathways, research, discounts, etc., – partners get access to an experienced team of professionals to help them make the most of their programs,” said Kirk Smallwood, senior vice president, US academic sales, CompTIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA has mapped &lt;a href="https://partners.comptia.org/resources/download-central?t=Exam%20Objectives"&gt;exam objectives&lt;/a&gt; to skills and competencies for IT and cybersecurity job roles to help you develop curriculum and build lesson plans — and we provide skills validation through our vendor- neutral, globally recognized certifications — giving your students a competitive edge in securing their dream tech job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA offers academic partnership to a variety of academic institutions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secondary schools (including career, vocational, or technical centers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colleges and universities (Traditional degree granting community and technical colleges and universities)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not-for-profit organizations that provide technology instruction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Government-funded educational agencies (outside of the U.S.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Department of Labor Job Corps Centers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Government and private correctional facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the launch of CompTIA Learning, we’ve worked with so many of our academic partners to successfully use it to build their IT curriculum,” Smallwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Removing Barriers to Entry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CompTIA’s &lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/content/research/it-industry-trends-analysis"&gt;IT Industry Outlook 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the growing demand for digital skills isn’t going away anytime soon. The demand for technology workers in all sectors continues to grow as technology influences every business and every industry vertical. &lt;a&gt;Despite this growth, the tech industry has the biggest confidence gap of any industry out there, according to Todd Thibodeaux, CEO of CompTIA.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having access to IT training and certifications helps to bridge the confidence gap and encourage students looking to get their foot in the door to IT. CompTIA learning solutions not only provide students with the technical knowledge they need to work in IT, but they also teach many valuable, durable soft skills that can transfer to other professions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students can benefit from access to our interactive &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/it-careers-path-roadmap"&gt;IT Career Pathway Planning tool&lt;/a&gt;, which provides details on how certifications can develop a variety of IT career pathways, giving them access to median annual salary data and employment forecasts for specific IT job roles they may be interested in exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA certifications are &lt;a&gt;job role-focused rather than technology-focused&lt;/a&gt;, providing student with the competencies needed for myriad employment opportunities. The vendor-neutral nature of CompTIA exams means that students that earn CompTIA certifications are more flexible and adaptable than IT professionals that specialize in one IT product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;IT Jobs Boast Sustainable Salaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing new curriculums is no easy feat, but the payoff for students impacted by IT programs is ten-fold. According to data from &lt;a&gt;CompTIA &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cyberstates.org/"&gt;Cyberstates&lt;/a&gt;, median tech wages are 125% higher than median national wages and the projected growth rate for tech jobs is nearly twice the national jobs rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Global Knowledge’s 2022 IT Skills and Salary Report, the average annual salary for an IT pro in 2022 was $110,765, a sizeable salary with growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even amidst world events like a global pandemic and time economic downturn, technology remains one of the most secure job sectors, so you can rest assured your students will be set up to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking to implement an IT curriculum at your academic institution?

The modern version is vi-Improved or Vim (pronounced "vim"). This tutorial covers how to get started using this powerful and standard text editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those new to command-line environments, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/comptia-linux-vim"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; can be a bit terrifying. It's a text editor designed for non-graphical interfaces, where there are no convenient pull-down menus or mouse-driven events. Everything is done with the keyboard. Linux servers often do not have a graphical user interface (GUI) installed, something startling to Windows and macOS users. Another significant difference is that Linux stores its configurations in text files, so if a Linux &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-systems-administrator"&gt;sysadmin&lt;/a&gt; needs to change a configuration (perhaps a network setting), they must edit a text file with a tool such as Vim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vim's use is not limited to sysadmins, however. Developers and standard users can get a great deal of mileage from this editor. I use it regularly on my Mac to create basic files quickly (such as the outline for this article) or as a way of generating markdown files that I need for various projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no certification course for Vim, it's an assumed skill for the &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux#examdetails"&gt;CompTIA Linux+&lt;/a&gt; exam, and the security professionals that pursue &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security#examdetails"&gt;CompTIA Security+&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst#examdetails"&gt;CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest#examdetails"&gt;CompTIA PenTest+&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/comptia-advanced-security-practitioner#examdetails"&gt;CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+&lt;/a&gt;) and other certifications will use Vim to accomplish their tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/SmartsheetB1/7b0217b5d0844437bc755a7df512c639?response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22Vim+Cheatsheet_v2.pdf%22%3Bfilename*%3DUTF-8%27%27Vim%2520Cheatsheet_v2.pdf&amp;amp;Signature=47voOWfmxVADLOywI9yobR0xW%2F4%3D&amp;amp;Expires=1675435425&amp;amp;AWSAccessKeyId=11950YFEZZJFSSKKB3G2" title="" target=""&gt;Download the Vim Cheatsheet here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's the best way to get started using this powerful editor? I suggest beginning with four fundamental tasks to manage any file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create/open&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working with a file, you must create or open it, make your changes, save them and then quit the Vim editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Install Vim&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before beginning, install Vim on your system. You may use Linux, Windows or macOS. Be aware that the steps vary a bit between versions and operating systems, so be ready to read the documentation specific to your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vim on Linux&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely your Linux distribution already includes Vim, but if it does not, follow these steps to install it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use a Linux distribution such as Fedora or CentOS, type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;$ sudo yum install vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian, type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;$ sudo apt install vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system should either install Vim or report that Vim already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vim on Windows&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows users can download Vim from the &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php"&gt;official download page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vim on macOS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac users can download MacVim from the same official download page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you use the Brew package manager, type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;$ brew install vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Vim is installed, you may follow the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 Basic Vim Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate these 4 skills, I will step through a scenario that creates a file, edits the contents, saves the changes and exits Vim. You must know these 4 skills; anything else you learn about Vim in the future simply makes you more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Create or Open a File&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using your chosen operating system, open a command line environment. In Linux, this is the &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/applying-your-linux-skills-to-macos-terminal-bash-and-common-commands"&gt;Bash terminal&lt;/a&gt;. On Windows, you will probably select &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/powershell-basics-cmdlets-integration"&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;. On a Mac, choose the &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/linux-and-z-shell"&gt;Zsh terminal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, browse to a directory you can use to create test files. Usually, whatever "home folder" your system gives you is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a new file named &lt;strong&gt;demo.txt&lt;/strong&gt; and open Vim simultaneously, type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;$ vim demo.txt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, this may look a bit different on each platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You've accomplished the first step: Create a file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim Command or Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;vim demo.txt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create or open the demo.txt file in Vim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vim Modes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can begin entering text into your file, you must understand Vim modes. Because Vim does not use a mouse and offers no menus, the only way to issue commands such as "save" or "quit" to Vim is via the keyboard. However, the keyboard is also how you type text in a file. So how does Vim know the difference between a command and words being typed in the file? The answer is by switching the keyboard between modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vim opens in Command mode. That means you are issuing commands to the program if you type something on the keyboard. The keyboard is "mapped" for commands. Vim's other mode is Insert. When in Insert mode, the keyboard is "mapped" to enter text into the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two simple ways to switch between modes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change from Command mode to Insert mode: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change from Insert mode to Command mode: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;ESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways of switching from Command mode to Insert mode. I am showing one easy-to-remember way. When you get more comfortable with Vim, you will learn other ways. Also, keep in mind that Vim commands are case-sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you created the &lt;strong&gt;demo.txt&lt;/strong&gt; file and opened it in Vim. By default, you are in Command mode. Before typing text into the file, you must switch to Insert mode. Do you remember the command?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim Command or Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch to Insert mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch to Command mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Edit a File&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Command mode, type &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; to switch to Insert mode. Notice the "-- INSERT --" flag in the lower left corner. You may now enter text into the file. Type the following into your file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;The lower-case i switches to Insert mode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;The ESC key switches to Command mode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good! Your file now has contents. But wait! How do you save these edits? First, you must switch back to Command mode. Which key is that again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Save a File&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;ESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure you are in Command mode. Now it's time to save your changes. In Vim, you don't "save" changes; you "write" them. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; command writes your changes to the disk. Notice the &lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;character. That switches to a third environment, Execute mode. Execute mode places a command prompt at the bottom of the screen and is enabled with the &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Command mode, press &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to save your changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return to Insert mode and enter another line of text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;To save your changes, switch to Command mode and type :w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return to Command mode and save the file with this new line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim Command or Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:w&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save or write changes to the file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Exit Vim&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, you've created a file, switched modes, entered a few lines of text, and saved your changes. How do you get out of Vim?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quit Vim, switch to Command mode and type the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; command. This returns you to your system's command line environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few useful tricks here. Frequently you'll want to both write your changes and quit Vim. Using the methods above, you would type &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (to save) and then&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:q&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(to quit). However, you could simply type &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:wq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to both write and quit using a single command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;img height="500px" title="vim-editor" alt="vim-editor" src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/vim-editor.gif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;

One of the first places I got trapped when learning Vim was exiting Vim without saving changes. Vim displays a red error if you try to quit without saving, and it refuses your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; command. To quit a file without saving changes, type &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:q!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; while in Command mode.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;img width="600px" title="novimsave" alt="novimsave" src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/novimsave.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top"&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim Command or Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:w&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save or write changes to the file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:q&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit Vim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:wq&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save changes and exit Vim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:q!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit Vim without saving changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;It's difficult to overstate how powerful Vim is and how many useful options exist. That's both the benefit and problem: Vim has so many choices that beginners are often overwhelmed. Hence, I advise learning the four common tasks before worrying about tips and tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Let me suggest just a few useful features you can experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Display Line Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Developers and sysadmins alike will appreciate having line numbers displayed along the left side of files. You might receive instructions that say, "edit line 42" and by default, Vim does not show line numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;To display line numbers in the current Vim session, enter Command mode and type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:set number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Use the&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:set nonumber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; command to turn off line numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;File Navigation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;You can navigate within a text file using the arrow keys. You can also use the&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;k&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;key to move up and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to move down. Move left with the &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;key and right with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; key. These navigation keys keep your fingers on the keyboard, making your typing more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Navigation or arrow keys are easy if the file is short. However, configuration files can be very long. During the editing process, you may need to move to the top or bottom of a file or to a specific line number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;To jump to the top of the file, switch to Command mode and type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;gg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;To jump to the bottom of the file, switch to Command mode and type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;To jump to a specific line number, such as line 42, switch to Command mode and type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;42G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Search a File&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Another useful trick is searching for a keyword or string of text. For example, to search for the "hostname" keyword, enter Command mode and type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;/hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This highlights all instances of the keyword. Use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to cycle forward through the results and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to cycle backward through the instances. Type &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;;"&gt;:nohl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to turn off highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This search is case-sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim Command or Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:set number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Display line numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:set nonumber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not display line numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;gg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump to the top of the file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;G&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump to the bottom of the file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;42G&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump to line 42 of the file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;/hostname&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="312" valign="top" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for the string "hostname" (case-sensitive)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Find the Time to Use Vim&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In many ways, Vim could be considered an archaic program. However, over the years, I've found myself using it more. Vim is one of the first programs I check for on my newly installed Linux systems. It's also something I routinely add to my Macs. It's not a replacement for a powerful word processor, but it certainly has its place with power users, developers and particularly administrators. The program is highly extensible and customizable, so once you get comfortable with the four standard tasks, you can begin to explore the options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Install Vim today and begin learning the basics of this powerful editor so you can apply your knowledge to Linux configurations throughout the CompTIA certification exams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready to get started? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/exam-objectives"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the CompTIA Linux+ exam objectives for free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; to see what's covered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Here are the top five.</description><link>https://www.comptia.org/blog/ethical-issues-in-technology</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 15:06:00 GMT</pubDate><a10:content type="text">&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/ethical-issues-in-tech.png?sfvrsn=79290fcc_2" data-displaymode="Original" alt="Ethical Issues in Tech" title="Ethical Issues in Tech"&gt;Ethics certainly creates a buzz in the business world. Ethical issues such as how we treat others, use information, engage with employees, manage resources, approach sustainability, and impact the world around us all affect how we view companies. In fact, the inappropriate treatment of people and the communities we live in are often the subject of scrutiny and can signal the difference between business success or failure. That’s why businesses (even tech giants such as &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/06/how-microsoft-openai-and-oecd-are-putting-ai-ethics-principles-into-practice/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;) often strive for ethical decision making and practices.&lt;h2&gt;Most Important Ethical Issues in Technology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Businesses today are faced with several ethical challenges. Critical decisions have to be made to ensure we are protecting personal freedoms and using data appropriately. Which ethical issues are the most important in 2023? Here are the top five.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Misuse of Personal Information&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the primary ethical dilemmas in our technologically empowered age revolves around how businesses use personal information. As we browse internet sites, make online purchases, enter our information on websites, engage with different businesses online and participate in social media, we are constantly providing personal details. Companies often gather information to hyper-personalize our online experiences, but to what extent is that information actually impeding our right to privacy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personal information is the new gold, as the saying goes. We have commoditized data because of the value it provides to businesses attempting to reach their consumer base. But when does it go too far? For businesses, it’s extremely valuable to know what kind of products are being searched for and what type of content people are consuming the most. For political figures, it’s important to know what kind of social or legal issues are getting the most attention. These valuable data points are often exploited so that businesses or entities can make money or advance their goals. Facebook in particular has come under fire several times over the years for selling personal data it gathers on its platform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Misinformation and Deep Fakes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing that became evident during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections was the potential of misinformation to gain a wider support base. The effect created polarization that has had wide-reaching effects on global economic and political environments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In contrast to how information was accessed prior to the internet, we are constantly flooded with real-time events and news as it breaks. Celebrities and political figures can disseminate opinions on social media without fact checking, which is then aggregated and further spread despite its accuracy—or inaccuracy. Information no longer undergoes the strenuous validation process that we formerly used to publish newspapers and books. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, we used to believe that video told a story that was undeniably rooted in truth. But deepfake technology now allows such a sophisticated manipulation of digital imagery that people appear to be saying and doing things that never happened. The potential for privacy invasion and misuse of identity is very high with the use of this technology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Lack of Oversight and Acceptance of Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most companies operate with a hybrid stack, comprised of a blend of third-party and owned technology. As a result, there is often some confusion about where responsibility lies when it comes to governance, use of big data, cybersecurity concerns and managing personally identifiable information or PII. Whose responsibility is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; to ensure data is protected? If you engage a third party for software that processes payments, do you bear any responsibility if credit card details are breached? The fact is that it’s everyone’s job. Businesses need to adopt a perspective where all collective parties share responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, many experts lobby for a global approach to governance, arguing that local policing is resulting in fractured policy making and a widespread mismanagement of data. Similar to climate change, we need to band together if we truly want to see improvement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Use of AI&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence certainly offers great business potential. But, at what point do AI systems cross an ethical line into dangerous territory?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facial recognition: Use of software to find individuals can quickly become a less-than-ethical problem. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/facial-recognition-software.html"&gt;According to the NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, there are various concerns about facial recognition, such as misuse, racial bias and restriction of personal freedoms. The ability to track movements and activity quickly morphs into a lack of privacy. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facial-recognition-tech-new-jersey-false-arrest-7c1237e3-88de-43cf-961f-14e562a4dc3b.html"&gt;Facial recognition also isn’t foolproof&lt;/a&gt; and can create bias in certain situations. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replacement of jobs: While this is anticipated to a certain degree, AI is meant to increase automation of low-level tasks in many situations so that human resources can be used on more strategic initiatives and complicated job duties. The large-scale elimination of jobs has many workers concerned about job security, but AI is more likely to lead to job creation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health tracking: The pandemic brought contact tracing into the mainstream. Is it ethical to track the health status of people and how will that impact the limitations we place on them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bias in AI technology: Technology is built by programmers and inherits the bias of its creators because humans inherently have bias. “Technology is inherently flawed. Does it even matter who developed the algorithms? AI systems learn to make decisions based on training and coding data, which can be tainted by human bias or reflect historical or social inequities,” &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/01/reviewing-the-top-ai-ethics-issues-that-could-affect-the-future-of-women-in-tech-and-how-to-combat-them/?sh=9df88f221755"&gt;according to Forbes&lt;/a&gt;. Leading AI developer Google has even experienced an issue where &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/google-translate-gender-bias/"&gt;AI software believes male nurses and female historians do not exist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Autonomous Technology&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars, robotic weapons and drones for service are no longer a thing of the future—they’re a thing of the present and they come with ethical dilemmas. Robotic machines in place of human soldiers is a very real possibility, along with self-driving cars and package delivery via unmanned drone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Autonomous technology packs a punch when it comes to business potential, but there is significant concern that comes with allowing programmed technology to operate seemingly without needed oversight. It’s a frequently mentioned ethical concern that we trust our technology too much without fully understanding it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ethical Practices in Technology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike business ethics, ethical technology is about ensuring there is a moral relationship that exists between technology and users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Respect for Employees and Customers&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Businesses that engage in ethical technology have a firm moral sense of employee rights and customer protections. Data is valuable, but the employees and customers who power your business are undoubtedly your greatest asset. Take care to always observe responsible protections for employees and customers to practice ethical technology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Moral Use of Data and Resources&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data is undoubtedly something of value for businesses. It allows companies to target their marketing strategies and refine product offerings, but it can also be an invasive use of privacy bringing many ethical considerations to the forefront. Data protection measures and compliance procedures can help ensure that data isn’t leaked or used inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Responsible Adoption of Disruptive Tech&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digital growth is a business reality. Disruptive tech often isn’t just a way to outpace the competition—it’s the only way to break even. But embracing new technologies doesn’t have to coincide with an ethical challenge. Do your due diligence to ensure that the technology you adopt has protections in place and you’ll be well on your way to practicing ethical tech. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Create a Culture of Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we need to create a culture of responsibility within technology. If the information technology workforce and industry giants believe they are responsible for the safe and ethical usage of technology, then we will see more governance and fair use of data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Emerging ethical dilemmas in science and technology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;New ethical problems regarding the use of science and technology are always arising. When is it right to use science and technology to apply to real-life scenarios and when does it impede human rights? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health tracking and the digital twin dilemma: Should organizations be able to create your twin in code and experiment on it to advance healthcare initiatives? And when does that become a practice of exploitation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurotechnology and privacy: Neurotechnology is nothing new, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics"&gt;new advances allowing the use of technology to gradually change behavior or thought patterns&lt;/a&gt; poses severe questions about privacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic engineering: While possessing great potential for human health and the recovery from damaging genetic mutations, there are considerable ethical considerations that surround the editing of the human genome. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weaponization of technology: While there is a lessened chance for loss of life, there are sincere ethical problems with weaponizing technology. At what point do we trust our technology to fight a war for us?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ethical decisions in technology should not be taken lightly. If we believe that technology can help to solve the world’s problems, addressing the ethics involved is the only way to us get there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with industry peers and participate in conversations about the technology topics that matter most. &lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/connect/communities" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Learn more about CompTIA Communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:5e9de232-5f2e-4327-99da-6835a774e310</guid><title>10 Things You Don’t Want to Miss at CCF 2023</title><description>If you’ve ever been part of a good brainstorm session, you understand what it feels like when the group knows they’re on to something.

&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 0px; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3jyxilZvlw?ecver=2" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px;" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;CompTIA Cloud+&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cybervista.net/top-10-cloud-certifications/" title="" class="" target=""&gt;CyberVista&lt;/a&gt; placed CompTIA Cloud+ on its list of top cloud certs for 2023 saying, “The CompTIA Cloud+ certification is an ideal vendor-neutral credential for entry-level professional or those working with multiple cloud platforms. Cloud+ is for practitioners looking to master the multi-vendor skills and abilities required for roles within data centers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new CompTIA Cloud+ certification domains include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloud architecture and design&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automation and virtualization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-availability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA Cloud+ (CV0-003) covers information security within the cloud at great depth. It ensures certification holders have the hands-on experience they need to secure cloud environments regardless of the vendor solution. This makes it a great foundational cloud certification that pairs well with any vendor-specific cloud computing certification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA Cloud+ is not an entry-level certification. It’s meant for IT pros with two to three years of experience in system administration or networking. Getting certifications like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/certifications/network"&gt;CompTIA Network+&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/certifications/server"&gt;CompTIA Server+&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;first set candidates up for success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s everything you need to know about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/the-new-comptia-cloud"&gt;the new CompTIA Cloud+ certification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the best cloud computing certifications you can earn this year is Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer. This certification enables an IT pro to step into a cloud DevOps engineer role. In this role, technicians develop operations that promote prompt delivery speed and reliable service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who earn this certification are skilled at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building software delivery pipelines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing incidents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploying and monitoring services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud DevOps is a niche field. Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer can get technicians into the field. This specialized certification is right for technicians who desire to work within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as a cloud engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer certification exam covers a variety of topics. A few examples include optimization of service performance, service-monitoring strategies and site reliability engineering principles. Think you may be interested in DevOps? Read&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/what-is-devops"&gt;What is DevOps and What Does it Mean for You?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just a small sampling of the best cloud computing certifications currently available. There are dozens out there, so do your research, especially if there is vendor-specific equipment you want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another one of the best cloud computing certifications on the market this year is the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP). This cloud certification supports cloud usage within an enterprise or organization. CCSP is a global credential that ensures technicians are on the cutting edge of cloud computing security and information security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates for the CCSP cloud certification must have at least five years of experience in IT. The experience must be cumulative, paid, full-time work. Earning CISSP, another certification by (ISC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), excludes candidates from the experience requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCSP certification exam covers cloud design, data, security, compliance and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in becoming a successful Microsoft cloud administrator? Azure Administrator Associate might be for you. Technicians who hold this certification have mastered the Azure fundamentals they need to implement, monitor and maintain Microsoft Azure solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates can expect the Azure Administrator Associate certification exam to cover services related to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate requires at least six months of on-the-job experience in the subject matter. Therefore, it is a good choice for beginners who want to work with Microsoft equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (CSAA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (CSAA) is a top certification for those with AWS cloud experience. It is intended for technicians who want to advance their career with AWS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified Solutions Architect was designed for those already in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-solution-architect"&gt;solutions architect&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;role. Candidates should have at least one year of experience designing distributed systems for AWS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This certification enables qualified candidates to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build and deploy secure, robust applications on AWS technologies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define cloud solutions using architectural design principles that are founded on customer requirements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer implementation guidance to AWS throughout the lifecycle of a project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage SaaS applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no official prerequisites for the CSAA. However, candidates for this certification should have at least two years of hands-on experience working in the AWS cloud. AWS Certified Developer is another AWS cloud certification qualified candidates may consider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which Cloud Certification Pays the Most?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons IT pros choose to go into cloud computing is because of the pay. But what is the ROI for individual cloud certifications? For starters, CompTIA Cloud+ yields an annual U.S. salary of $114,718, per the Global Knowledge 2021 IT Skills and Salary Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the other certifications listed above, here are the numbers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer: $107,907 (median salary in North America from January 1 to May 10, 2021, as reported by Burning Glass)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP): $127,000 (&lt;a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certification/average-ccsp-salary/" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Infosec Institute&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator Associate: $107,683 (&lt;a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-certifications-article" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Simplilearn&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate: $148,348 (Skillsoft 2022 IT Skills and Salary Survey)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Burning Glass data represents advertised salaries, and Global Knowledge data represents self-reported salaries. Existing workers with these certifications could be earning more (or in some cases less); as usual, location plays a significant role in salary variance. Advertised salaries aggregated from job postings tend to understate actual salaries (employers often do not include specifics on bonuses in job ads, job candidates in tight labor markets may negotiate higher pay or employers may not realize what the market will bear when posting a job ad). Read more about this in the article,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/it-job-myths-busted-what-is-an-average-salary"&gt;“IT Job Myths Busted: What Is an Average Salary?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these certifications pays well, and these figures may just be salary starting points for certification-holders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fine to want to earn a high level of income. At the same time, IT pros shouldn’t necessarily go for the cloud certification that pays the most on paper. They should pursue the certification that will further their career and give them a foundation of cloud skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want cloud skills that translate well across a variety of platforms, seek a vendor-neutral certification, like CompTIA Cloud+. Vendor-neutral certifications give you the skills needed to work with any cloud provider, or in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/single-cloud-or-multi-cloud"&gt;multi-cloud environment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendor-neutral certifications also complement vendor-specific certifications quite well. Stacking a vendor-neutral certification with a vendor-specific one may result in a higher salary than having a vendor-specific certification alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to get started as a cloud engineer? Check out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-cloud-engineer"&gt;Your Next Move: Cloud Engineer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which Cloud Computing Certification Should Beginners Start With?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners interested in cloud concepts should focus on getting a vendor-neutral cloud certification, such as CompTIA Cloud+, before any others. According to Security Degree Hub, people who choose to earn CompTIA Cloud+ first, and then add a vendor-specific certification are more established in the field. Beginners should also focus on getting some hands-on IT experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendor-specific cloud certifications or certification programs that don’t have prerequisites can feel overwhelming to beginners. Building a solid skill set that covers all things cloud is vital. It gives new IT pros the confidence they need to pursue the best cloud certifications throughout their career. It also provides them with knowledge that may make it easier to learn vendor-specific cloud concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why CompTIA Cloud+ is the Best Cloud Computing Certification for You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CompTIA Cloud+ is considered by staffing firms, colleges and IT publications to be one of the best cloud computing certifications. It is vendor neutral and complimentary to any vendor-specific cloud certification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href="https://certs.comptia.org/it-career-news-blog-subscription" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/04584-blog-lead-capture-image.png?sfvrsn=4802a136_6" displaymode="Original" alt="Sign up to receive a discount on CertMaster or an exam voucher" title="Infrastructure Lead Capture Ad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With CompTIA Cloud+, you are more likely to step into an expert-level IT role sooner than later. Global Knowledge reports that IT pros who earn CompTIA Cloud+ often become&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-security-administrator"&gt;security administrators&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-cloud-systems-administrator"&gt;cloud systems administrators&lt;/a&gt;, directors,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-network-engineer"&gt;network engineers&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-network-security-analyst"&gt;network security analysts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-network-support-specialist"&gt;network technicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA Cloud+ is the only vendor-neutral, performance-based certification that covers more than a specific vendor or a single function. It helps you better realize the return on investment of cloud infrastructure services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to start your cloud computing career? If so, begin gathering a set of cloud skills that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can apply to any equipment or vendor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a foundation for future cloud certifications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure a high level of income&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new CompTIA Cloud+, you can obtain this skill set.

But for someone whose primary role is not project management, some of the better-known project management certifications may go above and beyond what is needed to do the job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you work in IT and manage small- to medium-sized projects,&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/project"&gt;&amp;nbsp;CompTIA Project+&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;may be a good way for you to prove to employers that you have the project management skills needed for your job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which Project Management Certification is Right for Me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be hard to decide which project management certification is right for you. The good news is, project management certifications seem to fall into two categories: Those designed for full-time &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-it-project-manager"&gt;project managers&lt;/a&gt; and those designed for people in other jobs who are also responsible for some project management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PMP, and other project management certifications like Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or PRINCE2 Practitioner, are methodology/framework-specific certifications intended for more advanced project management professionals who oversee large projects. If you are a full-time&amp;nbsp;project manager,&amp;nbsp;PMP might be right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if your primary role is in IT but you also manage projects, CompTIA Project+ can help you understand project management concepts without investing the time and money that major project management certifications require. It is ideal for professionals who manage smaller, less complex projects as part of their other job duties but still need foundational project management skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA Project+ is more versatile than other certifications because it covers essential project management concepts beyond the scope of just one methodology or framework. However, it does provide a high-level introduction to Agile as part of one of the objectives. Still, if you would like to focus on, say Scrum specifically, you would want to take Scrum Alliance’s Certified Scrum Master certification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PMP vs. CompTIA Project+&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at the fundamental differences of PMP and CompTIA Project+. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CompTIA Project+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;tr&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;" align="right"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certification Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;CompTIA Project+ is ideal for IT professionals who need to manage smaller, less complex projects as part of their job duties and would benefit from foundational project management skills. Project+ is versatile because it covers essential project management concepts beyond the scope of just one methodology or framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: left;" =""="" telerik-retableevenrow-1"="" align=" right"&gt;PMP is a globally recognized, professional project management certification offered by PMI and is considered essential for full-time project managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Get a Project Management Certification?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting a project management certification validates your project management skills and adds value to your resume. You will be able to prove to employers that you bring in-demand and valuable skills to the table, opening yourself up to more job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;Lightcast, there were more than 600,000 job postings by U.S. employers for project managers in 2022, and 3.9 million postings seeking candidates with project management skills. Getting certified can also help you advance your career and earn more money. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),&amp;nbsp;the median annual salary for IT project managers in the United States is $94,500 – 107% higher than the median national wage for all occupations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://certs.comptia.org/it-career-news-blog-subscription" target="_blank" onclick="gtag('event', 'CtA Click', { 'event_category': 'Blog', 'event_label': '5-7-18 YNM Sec Admin Ad' });"&gt;&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/04584-blog-lead-capture-image.png?sfvrsn=4802a136_6" displaymode="Original" alt="Sign up to receive a discount on CertMaster or an exam voucher" title="Infrastructure Lead Capture Ad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earning CompTIA Project+ means that you will have the knowledge and skills required to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage the project lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure appropriate communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage resources and stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain project documentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both CompTIA Project+ and PMP require extensive preparation, and rightly so. Employees who invest in career development and learning are valued by their organization. A project management certification validates your desire and tenacity toward developing and honing your personal and professional skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you aren’t a full-time project manager – or aren’t one yet – CompTIA Project+ might be the right project management certification for you. It can even be a steppingstone for moving into a full-time project manager role or getting PMP or a more advanced certification in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to Study for CompTIA Project+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;When you’re &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/how-to-study-comptia-project-plus"&gt;ready to begin studying&lt;/a&gt;, check out CompTIA’s line of learning products, developed exclusively for the CompTIA certification candidate.

But do you know which ones will get you where you want to go? These are the most popular certifications.</description><link>https://www.comptia.org/blog/most-popular-it-certifications</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><a10:content type="text">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/most-popular-it-certifications-for-2022-(3).png?sfvrsn=625847bd_2" data-displaymode="Original" alt="Most Popular IT Certifications for 2022 (3)" title="Most Popular IT Certifications for 2022 (3)"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.skillsoft.com/it-skills-and-salary-report" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Skillsoft&lt;/a&gt; has released its annual report of the most popular IT certifications worldwide. According to the report, 91% of information technology professionals have at least one certification. In fact, respondents hold an average of four certifications in their field, with 41% of these earned in the last six months. Of course, the potential to advance your IT career, along with the possibility of making more money, is a huge incentive to becoming certified. But IT pros of all levels have other reasons as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After achieving a certification, IT professionals recognize the benefits immediately, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul type="disc"&gt; &lt;li&gt;An increase in work quality&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;More engagement with their work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Faster job performance &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why Are IT Certifications Popular?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking a deeper dive into why IT pros want to get certified, one thing is clear: It’s not always about the money. Obviously, a higher salary is beneficial, but that’s usually not the only driving force behind getting an IT certification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is IT professionals are hungry for knowledge and professional development and are driven to expand their areas of expertise. With that kind of attitude, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;IT Certifications Increase Job Effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salary aside, those who have recently earned an IT certification show increased job effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul type="disc"&gt; &lt;li&gt;56% say their quality of work has improved&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;41% say they are more engaged in their work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;36% say they are faster at performing their job&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about these numbers for a moment. Earning just one new IT certification results in 80% of IT pros feeling that their skill set is even more valued within their business. And they’re not the only ones who feel that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;IT Certifications Validate Skills&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2015, the percentage of companies reporting a skills gap has risen, according to the Skillsoft study. Close to 60% of all IT decision-makers anticipated a skills gap in 2022. And 41% of companies believe that certified staff are instrumental in closing skills gaps. In fact, more than 96% of IT managers say that certified staff add value to their organizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hiring managers cite the specific benefits of a certified staff:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;45% say certification boosts productivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;44% say certification meets client requirements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;37% say certification cuts down troubleshooting time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;35% say certification allows projects to be completed faster&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;35% say certification provides a competitive edge&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There it is. Certified professionals are better at closing skills gaps, satisfying client requests and increasing productivity while taking less time to do so. What business wouldn’t want that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What Are the Best IT Certifications for 2023?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While we certainly understand the value of IT certifications, choosing what certification program to pursue can be overwhelming. What IT certification is in demand for 2022 – and why?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations worldwide continue investing in certifications, but there has been a decrease in investments in certain skilled areas and IT decision makers are changing up where they are investing. In 2022, the top priority among decision makers was cloud computing, with 41% of decision makers listing it as their top focus. Coming in second for the first time in three years is cybersecurity, with 31%. Coming in at third and fourth are AI/ machine learning and infrastructure/ systems. What does this information suggest? IT managers are investing in areas where skills gaps lie in an effort to upskill current staff and fill gaps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among cybersecurity certifications, Microsoft ranks as the most popular worldwide, followed by ISACA and CompTIA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;img width="500px" title="8 Most Widely Held IT Certifications Worldwide" alt="8 Most Widely Held IT Certifications Worldwide" src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/8-most-widely-held-it-certifications-worldwide.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;1. Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Microsoft offers certification training in six areas: Azure, data &amp;amp; AI, Dynamics 365, the modern workplace, business applications, security and other specialty certifications.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/it-fundamentals"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;similarly to Microsoft Azure,&lt;em&gt; also focuses on the essential IT skills and knowledge needed to perform advanced end-user tasks and is a great option for people wondering if IT is right for them. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Google Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud certifications allows organizations to leverage Google Cloud technologies to drive business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/the-comptia-cybersecurity-career-pathway-employable-skills-found-here"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; includes CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+), CompTIA PenTest+ and CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+), and covers the skills cybersecurity pros need at all levels. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certifications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS certifications validate IT professional's technical skills and expertise in cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cloud"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CompTIA Cloud+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a vendor-neutral certification that builds a foundation of knowledge and skills that can be applied across all vendor products and helps IT pros compare the similarities and differences of cloud providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Cisco Certifications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vendor-neutral IT certifications like &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CompTIA Network+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;validate the skills needed to work on any equipment and provide foundational skills that will prepare you for vendor-specific certifications like CCNA. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. ITIL and IT Service Management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ITIL® Foundation was the most widely held certification in 2021, and ITIL and IT Service Management certifications now come in at number five.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cloud"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CompTIA Server+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a vendor-neutral certification that &lt;/em&gt;validates the hands-on skills of IT professionals who install, manage and troubleshoot servers in data centers as well as on-premises and hybrid environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. CompTIA Certifications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, a familiar name appears on the list of most popular worldwide IT certifications – and that’s CompTIA. CompTIA also places in the list of the most widely held security, governance, compliance and/or privacy-related certifications for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cloud"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CompTIA Cloud+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a vendor-neutral certification that builds a foundation of knowledge and skills that can be applied across all vendor products and helps IT pros compare the similarities and differences of cloud providers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Product Management, Agile and Scrum (PMP®, Scrum Master, Prince2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project management certifications help professionals to gain fundamental knowledge, terminology and processes of effective project management. Scrum certifications allow for individuals to learn the scrum framework, remove barriers to team progress, and help teams self-organize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/landing/certification-project/?utm_compid=cpc-google-paid_search_certs-Project%2B-text_ad-na-project-B2C&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sucBhDgARIsAFoytUuB-ZDMdsfMenGT-xq_urXlsgUI5h_E1kVe743e90B3jUyqxPppiDwaAn9TEALw_wcB" title="" class="" target=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CompTIA Project+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a versatile certification for IT professionals who coordinate or manage small-to-medium-sized projects. It covers essential project management concepts beyond the scope of just one methodology or framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. VMware&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware certifications range from data center virtualization, cloud management &amp;amp; automation, network virtualization, desktop and mobility and digital workspace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network" title="" class="" target=""&gt;CompTIA Network+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a vendor-neutral certification that prepares candidates to support networks on any platform. It is the only certification that covers the specific skills that network professionals need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;IT Certifications Are in Demand&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data from Lightcast, there were more than 164,000 job listings posted during 2022 that requested one or more of the following CompTIA certifications:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul type="disc"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a"&gt;CompTIA A+&lt;/a&gt; (47,200)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network"&gt;CompTIA Network+&lt;/a&gt; (51,100)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security"&gt;CompTIA Security+&lt;/a&gt; (102,500)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers illustrate not only that IT professionals are enthusiastic about obtaining IT certifications (especially CompTIA), but also that employers are regularly asking candidates to have these certifications in hand before applying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the more knowledge and experience you have, the more money you could earn. According to Skillsoft’s 2022 IT Skills &amp;amp; Salary Report, 22% of IT decision-makers say certified employees deliver $30,000 or more in additional value compared to non-certified employees. When it comes to salaries In North America, cybersecurity-certified professionals are paid highest, with an average salary of $123,370. Non-cybersecurity-certified IT pros are paid an average of $108,488. IT pros with specific in-demand skills, make more money earlier in their careers. &amp;nbsp;And it goes without saying that a higher-level certification often comes with a bigger paycheck. &lt;ins cite="mailto:Emily%20Matzelle" datetime="2023-01-23T11:40"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you consider all the positives that come with earning an IT certification, it makes complete sense that so many IT pros are going after certifications with such passion. Self-confidence, extensive knowledge, reliability, top-notch performance, expedited promotions and a career path with an upward trajectory are all great reasons to get certified. And, ultimately, if it helps boost your salary – there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Get CompTIA Certified&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA certifications have a long-standing history of being the industry credentials you need to show employers you have the IT skills they are looking for.

The complexity layers on top of that but think of the metaverse as a world for a digital user to enter, interact, learn, transact, create and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much innovation—and opportunity—happening around the metaverse, it makes sense why Facebook rebranded to Meta in order to support their metaverse-focused strategy. With that in mind, here are six reasons why we’re ready for the metaverse—and you should be as &lt;a&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="callout blue"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/content/research/it-industry-trends-analysis"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more about Web3 technologies in the CompTIA IT Industry Outlook 2023.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Social Media at an Inflection Point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first began my social media journey on Myspace. Myspace was a fun place for myself and my friends: We had our Top 8 lists, our HTML-tiled backgrounds, our profile page song, emo poetry, etc. It was simply a place to be young and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next came Facebook, which was first accessible to Ivy League schools and then subsequently colleges with strong engineering departments, and then all collegiate domains. We poked each other and posted silly photographs. Eventually Facebook opened its doors to any registered and verified email address. Fast forward to omnipresence, controversy, acquisitions, Hollywood films and the story continues to be written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then LinkedIn changed everything. Suddenly users who weren’t interested in social media found a reason to join a social network. LinkedIn keeps you close to your working peers, helps you find a job and educates you with targeted professional content. An entire audience of users who weren’t interested in having fun on a social network found a grown-up reason to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the inflection point we are at with the metaverse going into 2023. Social media has reached a terminal state, with the only variation between platforms now being the format: Text and/or video and the length allowed or incentivized by the social media platform itself. The way a user interacts with social media has not changed since the proliferation of the smartphone. And if social media continues to tether itself to smart phones, it will become less important over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Smartphones at a Terminal State&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metaverse is only as enriching as the devices that we use to access it. And while the metaverse is blossoming, it is currently being held back by the massive market adoption cycle of the smartphone and the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that create them. The smartphone is a dead end in terms of innovation. You can make it smaller or bigger, add a stylus, make it fold, add better cameras, memory, etc., but at the end of the day it’s a touchscreen slab that ties back to app stores. Because smart phones are essentially done iterating upon the way that we interact with them, the door is open to something new. The smartphone is simply an input terminal like the keyboard and mouse or the punch card before it. There will be a new way forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Wearable Technology at a Maturation Point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever talked to someone about their smart watch? Chances are they are obsessed with it. And it’s clear to see why. Smart watches are stylish, sleek and practical. Are VR headsets there yet? No, but we are starting to see stratification and affordability make an impact in the wearable headset market. Did you know you can buy a headset for $5, load in your smartphone (which now has a reinvented purpose), tether a $2 Bluetooth controller and enter the metaverse? This will be the method most users adopt as Oculus/Meta Quest style headsets are still too expensive and quite frankly, overkill for most use cases and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newly burgeoning industry is at an interesting maturation point as we wait for a major player to enter the space: Apple. In the American market especially, Apple is responsible for driving smartphone, smart watch and Bluetooth headphone adoption. Apple is, in fact, the largest headphone manufacturer in the world, which many do not realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many in the industry expect a 2023 announcement and release for an &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks"&gt;Apple AR and VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, which could spur mass adoption as the company has done in other categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Education: The Commerce of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings are experiential learners, but the science of education (pedagogy) is still deeply misunderstood and unexplored. Why does this matter to the metaverse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an education professional, I am familiar with the 80/20 rule as it applies to learning. This means that if I train someone in a lecture with traditional audio-visual (AV) support (slideshows, videos, graphics), they will retain 20% of what I say. This leads to the practice of interval training. Interval training consists of brief and consistent reinforcement of the training material over time in order to drive that knowledge retention number higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/08/17/virtual-reality-hospitals/"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; conducted a study of medical professionals using VR training and traditional AV training as a control group. They then tested the students one year later to see what knowledge retention looked like. The traditional AV training had predictable results with around 20% retention after a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The users who adopted VR training had an 80% knowledge retention rate a year later. There is a dollar and workforce impact in hands-on experiential learning that can’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Videoconference Education a Band Aid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have kids of schooling age or took educational courses during the pandemic, you probably aren’t a huge fan of virtual education. This can be for a variety of reasons, but once you extract value vs. cost and opinions vs. politics, the simple fact remains that &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/08/17/virtual-reality-hospitals/"&gt;audio-visual training is not optimal from a learning impact standpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If students can fully immerse themselves with classmates, be themselves, interact with shared objects that are spatially tethered and collaborate in real time, this removes some of the largest barriers to education that exist in our systems today. This is the promise of the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in the benefits of democratizing information for diverse cultures and people around the world, curated learning, assistance for those with disabilities, and a centric model for those who experience challenges leaving their home and you have an inescapable model of decentralized learning where the institution is no longer the focal point but the user themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means educational institutions are in for some turbulent times ahead unless they begin forging their own path within the metaverse and AR/VR technologies to prepare for the students of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the record, these students of the future are already here. They are already tired of outdated learning management systems (LMS). I used them when I went to college two decades ago, and I have built multiple LMS instances in my professional career. Like the smartphone, they are at a terminal state, where the only updates are content and APIs vs. the updates to interaction and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true obstacle here is educational institutions and their understanding of how knowledge is gained. We still use multiple choice scantron style tests in high schools. This isn’t because it’s how students learn best, its simply because “that’s the way we’ve always done it.” When funding is tied to these antiquated evaluation methods, the real opponent becomes the decoupling of dollars from outdated methodologies that are not student or learning outcome centric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Demographic Waves of Change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 20 years, there will be more gamers on the planet than there are today. This is simple demographics as many older generations were not native to video games and do not play them. These older generations will pass away and be replaced with younger generations who game to have fun and have social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon to find a gamer who &lt;a href="https://nerdist.com/article/how-assassins-creed-is-helping-students-learn-about-history/"&gt;learned more about history from Assassin’s Creed&lt;/a&gt; than they did from high school history, and this is for a very good reason: They experienced it. They walked the streets of Jerusalem or jumped rooftops in Revolutionary Paris taking in an immersive world that taught them about the culture of those people and times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Microsoft has agreed to make &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/"&gt;the largest acquisition in the history of their entire organization&lt;/a&gt;—for a video game studio, Activision/Blizzard. Microsoft was not purchasing Call of Duty. They were entering a talent war for 3D rendering artists to build their own metaverse, and now they have one of the most accomplished video game design teams on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metaverse is Now, Extended Reality is Future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all new technology movements, the first rung of the strategy is to normalize the foreign experience of the technology. This is why you see so much marketing of metaverse before seeing high adoption rates into the ecosystem. The goal is to make the term “metaverse” as ubiquitous as possible, so it won’t be abnormal when your child comes home from the first day of school with a headset instead of an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players and users are already spending massive amounts of time inside of ecosystems like Second Life or massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). While these ecosystems don’t have a specific business or educational component to them, they are tangible proof that people will spend large amounts of time in a virtual world if the experience caters to their specific needs and gives them a communal aspect of play and relationship building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's clear to see that building an open and distributed ecosystem is easier to write out than it is to execute with private and public companies vying for their postage stamp of turf. That’s why, once again, the user is the crux of making this entire Web3 movement a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will need the true realization of extended reality (XR). XR is a merging of AR and VR technologies into one seamless experience with the user driving the type of experience and the engagement level required. This would mean that a user could opt into the AR or VR experience depending on their preference or the hardware that they possess on hand. Think of it as being somewhat akin to a hybrid vehicle that allows you to select battery or combustion engine, or both. This power of choice will drive the greatest number of users provided that the economics to opt in passed down to the user are fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to participate in discussions about the metaverse and other innovative technologies?

The cost for security services will be largely based on your status as a small business, SMB or enterprises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/367141"&gt;According to leaders such as IBM&lt;/a&gt;, your cybersecurity budget should consist of 9-14% of your overall IT budget. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/217362/worldwide-it-security-spending/" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Statista reports&lt;/a&gt; $71.68 billion in IT security spend in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.secureworks.com/blog/6-considerations-for-your-companys-cybersecurity-budget"&gt;Cisco showed&lt;/a&gt; that 50% of large enterprises are spending $1 million annually on security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Cybersecurity Job Statistics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity pros are in high demand. The growth of cybersecurity incidents has led to an increased need for skilled cybersecurity professional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In fact, it’s estimated that there will be &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/the-top-9-jobs-in-cybersecurity" title="" class="" target=""&gt;3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the end of 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The job market is expected to grow 33% between 2021 and 2031, &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm"&gt;according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The median average wage for a cybersecurity pro is $102,600, according to the BLS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Related Content: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuqIJd7KnBU-FQL2gwuT0FjspqG9AKZKC" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Tough Talk on Cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/X4erAqZtR1o" title="" class="" target=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Top Cybersecurity Threats and Trends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies are working diligently to ensure they are prepared for anything that comes their way in the future. Expect to see the following.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced software supply chain security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ransomware will become more of a problem for businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies are transitioning to a &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/what-is-zero-trust-and-why-does-it-work" title="" class="" target=""&gt;zero trust framework&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for cybersecurity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased scrutiny on the cybersecurity measures of third-party providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rise in cyber insurance to offer further protection for businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cost of Cybercrime&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cyber crime is a costly expenditure for companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cost of cyber crime has risen 10% in the past year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average cost of a data breach in the United States in 2022 was $9.44 million, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" title="" class="" target=""&gt;IBM data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damage-costs-10-trillion-by-2025/" title="" class="" target=""&gt;Cybersecurity Ventures&lt;/a&gt; predicts cybercrime will cost $10,5 trillion annually by 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Protect Yourself From Cyberattacks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Protecting yourself from cyberattacks often involves the right education. As noted above, most cyber incidents evolve by way of human error, not a failing in technology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate your people: Train your staff to recognize different types of attacks, such as phishing and email scams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable multifactor authentication: Requiring more robust authentication helps to enhance your security significantly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform penetration testing: Pen testing allows you to assess the vulnerabilities on your systems so you can appropriately safeguard against weaknesses. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor threat intelligence: Threat intelligence feeds provide valuable, real-time information on emerging cybersecurity threats and allows for a collaborative approach to incident response. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cybersecurity Statistics FAQ&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Are the Types of Cyberattacks?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several different types of cyber attacks. Here are some of the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-phishing/" title="" target=""&gt;Phishing&lt;/a&gt;: Involves sending a fraudulent message in an attempt to get the recipient to provide sensitive information, such as password credentials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-malware" title="" target=""&gt;Malware&lt;/a&gt;: Involves using viruses, spyware or other malicious software to steal information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-ransomware/" title="" target=""&gt;Ransomware: &lt;/a&gt;Where data is stolen and only released upon payment of ransom. However, this data typically becomes available on the dark web regardless of payment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DoS (denial of service)/&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-a-ddos-attack-how-it-works/" title="" target=""&gt;DDoS (distributed denial of service):&lt;/a&gt; Attacks deny access to systems making business inoperable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Many Cybersecurity Attacks Are There Per Day?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;There are an average of &lt;a href="https://www.cobalt.io/blog/cybersecurity-statistics-2023" title="" class="" target=""&gt;2,200 incidents per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Frequent Are Cyberattacks? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study by the University of Maryland indicates that there is a cyber attempt every 39 seconds. That number is almost incomprehensible. Not all of the attempts are successful, but you can be guaranteed that someone at some point in time (or several points in time) has tried to steal your personal information. Unfortunately this problem isn’t going away anytime soon. But fortunately, the cybersecurity industry is growing and learning at the same rate the bad actors are. Do what you can to protect yourself. The cybersecurity market will only grow so make sure you are prepared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://connect.comptia.org/membership/comptia-isao" title="" class="" target=""&gt;CompTIA ISAO&lt;/a&gt;, included in MSP and solution provider member benefits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:3b18c275-4b48-4171-af74-763f5bec104b</guid><title>Pair CompTIA A+ with Project+ for a 1-2 Punch</title><description>IT pros must possess a robust set of technical skills and are now expected to be able to participate in projects, write reports and communicate with IT project teams.</description><link>https://www.comptia.org/blog/pair-a-with-project-for-a-1-2-punch</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 13:30:02 GMT</pubDate><a10:content type="text">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/images/default-source/blogs/pair-a-with-project.png?sfvrsn=d1e02e7_2" data-displaymode="Original" alt="PAIR A+ with Project+" title="PAIR A+ with Project+"&gt;When you think about iconic duos, a few pairs come to mind: Abbott and Costello, Thelma and Louisa, Woody and Buzz Lightyear – even the traditional peanut butter and jelly. It’s high time we add &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a"&gt;CompTIA A+&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/project"&gt;CompTIA Project+&lt;/a&gt; to this list. Why? Well, the thing about iconic duos is that they work well together. And that couldn’t be truer of the skills an IT professional gains when they are both CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Project+-certified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t just take our word for it. There’s plenty of proof that the skills you learn when you become certified in CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Project+ are the same skills employers are looking for in entry-level tech jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Entry-level IT Jobs that Map to CompTIA A+&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CompTIA A+ certification&amp;nbsp;is the industry standard for establishing a career in IT and is the preferred qualifying credential for technical support and IT operational roles. If you want to break into the IT industry, this is where many start. Even as a steppingstone to another IT role, entry-level jobs in tech are plentiful and pay well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual salary for tech support specialists in the United States is $53,000&amp;nbsp;– 26%&amp;nbsp;higher than the national median wage. And the latest &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report"&gt;CompTIA Tech Jobs Report&lt;/a&gt; shows that there were more than 18,500 open positions for IT support specialists in December 2022. Case in point, entry-level jobs in tech are ready and waiting for qualified IT pros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are CompTIA A+-certified, consider yourself qualified for these jobs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-help-desk-technician"&gt;Help desk technician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-it-specialist"&gt;IT specialist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-tier-ii-it-support-technician"&gt;Tier II IT support technician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-field-service-technician"&gt;Field service technician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-technical-support-specialist"&gt;Technical support specialist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/comptia-a-plus-jobs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more about the jobs you can get with CompTIA A+.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like any other job, just because you are qualified doesn’t mean you’re a shoe-in. Setting yourself apart from the competition is crucial in any job market, and one of the best ways to win an entry-level tech job today is to show employers that you possess more than the technical knowledge necessary to be successful. Enter CompTIA Project+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Value of Adding Project Management Skills to Your Technical Portfolio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, many of us thought working in technology meant being holed up in a dark room by yourself and your machine. It’s safe to say we’ve blown that stereotype out of the water. IT pros aren’t working in silos anymore. They are an integral part of any organization and have to be able to communicate with people outside of the IT department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company-wide initiatives are looping in IT from the start, and you have to be able to work well with others in order to achieve your objectives. That’s exactly why being able to manage a project lifecycle, ensure appropriate communication, manage resources and stakeholders, and maintain proper documentation – in addition to your technical skills – will set you up for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few desired qualifications – taken straight from real job descriptions – for the above-listed roles. It’s easy to see that these jobs involve more than strict troubleshooting and system updates. They also require a set of professional and organizational skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show potential employers that you are capable of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing training materials and procedures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Training users in the proper use of hardware and software&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conferring with staff, users and management to establish new requirements for new systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Documenting solutions to common problems and responses to frequently asked questions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining effective work direction, scheduling and time management skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building and maintaining exceptional vendor relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective writing and oral communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with minimal supervision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can always say you are competent and ready to take on these tasks. But validating that knowledge with a certification is always a good investment in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Skills Does CompTIA Project+ Cover?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT hiring managers are looking for IT pros who can participate in projects, write reports and communicate with IT project teams. CompTIA Project+ is perfect for IT pros who are (or will be) required to oversee smaller, less-complex projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT professionals must possess a robust set of hard skills but are increasingly expected to have a set of professional skills, including the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage the project lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure appropriate communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage resources and stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain project documentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, CompTIA Project+ meets current industry needs by promoting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An IT focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Hiring managers place a lot of value on IT pros who can skillfully manage IT projects and clearly communicate with project teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An agile focus:&lt;/strong&gt; CompTIA Project+ also promotes a focus on agile methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A risk management focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Regulations related to HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST and more call for a higher level of compliance from IT departments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/the-new-comptia-project-your-questions-answered"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more about the new CompTIA Project+.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Skills Does CompTIA A+ Cover?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CompTIA A+ covers the skills needed for technical support roles and help desk jobs. This certification is pivotal in supporting today’s ever-evolving technologies in a high-demand field supporting the hybrid workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Core 1 exam (220-1101) covers five disciplines for IT pros to effectively perform job roles tasked with endpoint and end-user related skills:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hardware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtualization and Cloud Computing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hardware and Network Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Core 2 exam (220-1102) covers four different areas that IT pros will be tested on to demonstrate their knowledge and mastery:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/comptia-a-plus-has-two-exams"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more about the CompTIA A+ exams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Invest in Yourself: Get Certified Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that the technology industry is ever-evolving is your first step toward becoming an attractive candidate for an entry-level tech job. Employers want the whole package. And while that doesn’t mean you have to know everything up front, it does bode well to have certifications like CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Project+ under your belt. With those certifications, you’re showing potential employers that you have the skills they want, and you have a dedication to continued learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While certifications are a worthwhile investment in yourself, continued upskilling comes with a cost. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/voucher-discount"&gt;ways to save money&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’re certified, leverage CompTIA’s &lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/get-a-tech-job-with-comptia-and-ziprecruiter"&gt;partnership with ZipRecruiter&lt;/a&gt; to match your CompTIA credentials with open jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ready to get started? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-objectives"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the exam objectives for free to see what's covered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</a10:content></item></channel></rss>
